Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth.

By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April.

The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024.

The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology.

At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

It means that for anyone planning a trip to this north African country, the Israel-Hamas war will be a key concern, especially as fighting has also intensified between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn October 26, Israel carried out military action against Iran. Dozens of fighter jets hit Iranian ballistic missile production facilities, missile launchers and air defence batteries in an attack that was codenamed “Days of Repentance”. The attacks were in retaliation to the events on October 1, when Iran launched around 180 missiles at Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had warned of “consequences” after the attack.\\n\\nBut while it’s geographically close to the conflict, the UK Foreign Office does not advise against travel to the main tourist areas of Egypt. However, there are large parts of the country that the UK Foreign Office does warn against travelling to. There are also safety considerations to bear in mind even when you’re travelling to the main tourist areas.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to the Middle East right now?\\n\\nWhat’s the latest government advice about travelling to Egypt?\\n\\nThere are no travel advisories in place for popular tourist spots in Egypt such as Cairo, cities along the Nile including Luxor and Aswan, and resorts by the Red Sea such as Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada. These are all considered safe by the UK government.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt on October 26 following Israel’s attacks on Iran. It warns ongoing hostilities in the Middle East could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai, which includes the crossing at Rafah, and within 20km of the Egyptian/Libyan border (excluding El Salloum, where it advises against all but essential travel).\\n\\nIt also advises against all but essential travel to the following areas:\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing US and UK strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, the Foreign Office said: “Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that travel advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor travel advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.”\\n\\nThis advice is still current and has not changed since the Iranian missile attack on Israel.\\n\\nSeparately, the Foreign Office has warned that terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, and targets could include destinations popular with tourists. Most attacks in the past have been in the North Sinai region, but they may take place in other parts of the country too.\\n\\nThe risk is heightened during public holidays and festivals, such as Christmas and Ramadan, and is particularly high around religious sites, large public gatherings and places frequented by foreigners. Stay vigilant and carry your photo ID with you at all times.\\n\\nHas Egypt been affected by the conflict in the Middle East?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn September 29, the UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt, saying: “Ongoing hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region. Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.”\\n\\nSharing a border with both Israel and Gaza has meant that Egypt is closer to the conflict than any other nation. On October 27, 2023, an official confirmed that a drone fell near a medical facility in the Red Sea resort of Taba, near the Israeli border, injuring six people.\\n\\nSeparately, two Israeli tourists and their local guide died after a police officer opened fire on a group of Israeli tourists in Alexandria on October 8, 2023, according to reports by the Israeli foreign ministry. This has not been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.\\n\\nMore generally, the Foreign Office warns that the border between Israel and Egypt at Taba could close at short notice. Visitors should check with local authorities before trying to cross. It also warns that since the Israel-Hamas war started, demonstrations (often at short notice) have taken place. Tourists should be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is currently closed. The Foreign Office says that when this border is reopened, Israel, Egypt and the authorities in Gaza may determine procedures for who is permitted to cross and when. Humanitarian aid workers cannot enter or exit Gaza through Egypt at this time.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to Israel right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Turkey right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Dubai right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Cyprus right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Morocco right now?\\n\\nIs Cairo safe?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Cairo and this advice has not changed since the US and UK joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, nor after the increased air strikes between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024.\\n\\nHowever, it’s a big and busy city so it’s still worth staying vigilant for petty crime. Female travellers should also take care — as in other parts of the country, harassment and sexual assault can and do happen.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nSharm el-Sheikh reopened to British tourists in October 2019, four years after a bomb exploded on a Russian plane carrying 224 tourists and crew. Security measures were increased at the Red Sea resort: x-ray scanners in hotels, security walls and high perimeter fences around the airport were installed.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office no longer advises against travel to the area of Sharm el-Sheikh. This advice has not changed since the US and UK launched joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen at the beginning of 2024.\\n\\nFor context, the attacks in the Red Sea have been limited to the south, while the Egyptian Red Sea resorts are in the north, more than 1,000 miles away.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Hurghada?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Hurghada, a popular Red Sea resort. Again, travel advice has not been amended for the resort following the strikes on the Houthi bases in Yemen, nor after the intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you drink alcohol in Egypt?\\n\\nEgypt is an Islamic country. While attitudes are more relaxed in tourist resorts, customs can be very different elsewhere and more strict during Ramadan. Public drinking, for example, can lead to arrest — alcohol is only permitted in a licensed restaurant or bar.\\n\\nPossession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs can lead to long prison sentences or even the death penalty. Visitors should be aware that what is legal in the UK may not be legal in Egypt. In 2017, for example, a British woman was jailed for three years for taking painkillers into the country. Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is a prescription drug in the UK but is illegal in Egypt.\\n\\nWhat about taking photos in Egypt?\\n\\nBe aware of what you’re photographing. Taking pictures of military installations (strictly prohibited), embassies, government buildings, churches and even infrastructure such as train stations can lead to arrest. If you want to photograph any Egyptian citizens, you must have written permission from them; photographing children is not permitted.\\n\\nTaking or sharing photographs that are perceived to be damaging to the country’s image is also forbidden. Similarly, making strongly negative comments about Egypt or its politics, including on social media, can lead to you being detained.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are Egypt’s entry restrictions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor entry into Egypt, you’ll need at least six months of validity on your passport. You’ll also need to apply for a tourist visa to visit most of the country. These can be obtained online before you travel or on arrival at dedicated desks inside the airport. This is valid for up to three months.\\n\\nIf you’re travelling to the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you can get a free entry permission stamp upon arrival for stays of up to 15 days. You’ll have to get a visa if you want to stay longer or visit other places.\\n\\nDo I need vaccines for Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nThere are no essential vaccine requirements for visiting Egypt. However, the NHS suggests that it’s advisable to have polio and tetanus jabs. You may also want to consider hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies and typhoid.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of safety on the ground, it pays to be vigilant. Protests take place frequently and foreigners taking part in political activities in the country could be detained or subjected to other measures.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office says: “If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the immediate area as the atmosphere could change quickly and without warning. Police have previously used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition for crowd control.”\\n\\nAt popular tourist spots, visitors can be harassed for money or to buy things. There’s also a risk of theft and mugging, even in taxis. Travelling as part of an escorted tour can help reduce the risks. If you are a victim of crime, you should contact the local tourist police who can help you make a report.\\n\\nPublic displays of affection can also be frowned upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for female travellers?\\n\\nIn general, yes, it is safe for female travellers. However, there have been reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment in the country, including some affecting minors. Most of the reported incidents have taken place in the Red Sea region and, according to the Foreign Office, are often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office advises: “Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.”\\n\\n What can women do to stay safe while abroad?\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for LGBT travellers?\\n\\nIt can be problematic for LGBT travellers. While homosexuality is not technically illegal in Egypt, according to the Foreign Office, the charges of “debauchery” and “sexual deviance” have been used to prosecute LGBT people in the past. Dozens of people were arrested in 2017 on debauchery charges after waving a rainbow flag at a concert in Cairo, for example. Again, attitudes are more relaxed in tourist areas but public displays of affection are likely to cause issues.\\n\\n Is it safe to go diving in the Red Sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Egypt travel advice: is it safe to visit right now?', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Burlington Times-News']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-10-26T11:32:14+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'ce38fd6e-5797-58d2-a684-bcdd25b14c1f', 'text': ' The arbitrary arrests appear to be based on the detainees’ present or past employment.\\n\\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, carried out these arbitrary arrests while widespread hunger and thirst remain rampant across Yemen, including in areas they control, and during a recent, major cholera outbreak that the Houthis hid for several months, based on ongoing Human Rights Watch research.\\n\\n“The Houthis are using arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances as a political tool at a time when the people living in their territories lack even the most basic needs,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should immediately release all of these people, many of whom have spent their careers working to improve their country.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch spoke to 20 people with knowledge of the arrests, as well as 4 Yemen analysts. Their identities are not being revealed for their safety, as they fear reprisals. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents, videos, social media, and media reports, voice recordings, and other materials relevant to the detentions.\\n\\nHouthi forces did not present search or arrest warrants at the time of arrest, and the authorities have refused to tell families where those arrested are being held, meaning that these acts amount to enforced disappearances. They have held detainees incommunicado, without access to lawyers or their families. On June 19, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Houthi human rights office with questions regarding the arrests and concerns about the apparent absence of any due process. The Houthis have not responded.\\xa0\\n\\nAs far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, no charges have been brought against the people detained. However, Houthi authorities have a long history of bringing dubious charges against detained people, including espionage.\\n\\nStarting on June 10, Houthi authorities released a series of videos and curated social media posts on the Houthi-affiliated TV channel, Al-Masirah, and its related social media platforms. These show 10 Yemeni men who were detained between 2021 and 2023. Most of them have been held incommunicado.\\n\\nThe videos show the men confessing that they were spying for the United States and Israel, but there is a high risk that these confessions were coerced. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain confessions. Publishing videos of confessions undermines the right to fair trial and lacks credibility.\\n\\nThough the Houthis have not said whether the current arrests are linked to the videos and their related announcements of uncovering a “spy network,” sources, including analysts, said that they feared that the Houthis were trying to frame the recently detained people as spies.\\n\\nYemen analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch also suggested political motives for the arrests. The Yemeni government-controlled central bank issued a decision on May 30 to end transactions with six banks within Houthi territories that refused to move their headquarters to Aden, which is under the control of the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The decision has the potential for a significant negative economic impact on Houthi-controlled territories. Analysts said that the arrests may be an attempt to put pressure on the Yemeni government to reverse the decision.\\n\\nEnforced disappearances, in which the authorities detain a person and then refuse to acknowledge their whereabouts or situation when asked, are serious crimes under international law and are prohibited at all times under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\\n\\nAll of the detainees are Yemenis. The Houthis have told families not to speak out about the detention of their family members, in many cases saying that detainees will be released as soon as the Houthis have completed their interrogations, as long as they do not find anything.\\n\\n“[The Houthis] know there will not be an [international] escalation from the arrest of the Yemenis, but if they arrested international staff there will be a huge escalation from the international community,” said one source.\\n\\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, have called for the release of all UN and nongovernmental organization staff, as have other senior UN officials.\\n\\nHowever, some sources also told Human Rights Watch that the UN agencies or organizations where detainees had been working had not made efforts to contact detainees’ families, including those living abroad who could have been safely reached.\\xa0\\n\\n“Continuing to work like business as usual cannot be done,” a source said. “The abductees that were part of the confessions yesterday, there was no huge demand for their release, barely anything was said by UN agencies,” referring to those shown in videos.\\xa0\\n\\nOne political analyst said that “he wider weak international reaction … proves that from [the Houthis’] perspective, they did the right thing.”\\n\\nIt is imperative for the United Nations, independent groups working in Yemen, and concerned governments to take every action in their power to ensure the release of those detained, Human Rights watch said. Oman, which has been a mediator in negotiations between the Houthis and other warring parties, should work with other countries collectively to ensure that the Houthis release the detainees.\\n\\n“The international community should be doing everything in their power to ensure that these people are immediately released,” Jafarnia said. “Many of them have been invaluable members of Yemeni civil society organizations and staff in UN agencies and nongovernmental international groups.”\\n\\nBased on interviews with informed sources, Human Rights Watch found that, starting on the morning of Friday, May 31, Houthi forces began arresting employees of several nongovernmental organizations, raiding their homes and offices, though a few arrests were before that date. According to one source, more than 60 people had been arrested as of June 12.\\n\\nIn one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children – a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old – of a woman who works with a civil society organization, a source said.\\n\\nIn all but one case, Houthi forces did not tell relatives where they were taking the person arrested, and none have had contact with their family members since they were arrested, as far as Human Rights Watch could determine. With the exception of one case, the authorities did not tell relatives where their loved ones have been detained when asked. Such conditions amount to enforced disappearance.\\n\\nOn June 18, Volker Türk said that the six staff members from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) who had been detained “have not had contact with their families, nor has the UN been able to access them.” In separate statements, he added that two other staff, who have been “held incommunicado, without any due process,” and two staff from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), had “already been arbitrarily detained for a lengthy period.”\\n\\n“I can’t even describe the fear and concern that all of these people had for their safety and well-being,” one source said. “[The head of one organization] couldn’t eat for an entire week.”\\xa0\\n\\nWhile the conditions of those disappeared remains unknown, many sources said that the Houthis had not allowed family members to send needed medicines for the detainees, including for serious medical conditions. Human Rights Watch has documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention since 2015.\\n\\nSince the initial raids and arrests on May 31 and June 6, the Houthis have continued arresting people, prompting many people in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to flee their territory.\\xa0\\n\\nOne person who left Sanaa said, “Although I managed to flee.… I couldn’t sleep … I’ve had panic attacks every day since I fled from Sanaa … I’m very worr[ied] about my friends and colleagues in Sanaa who are just waiting for Houthis to arrest them.”\\xa0\\n\\n', 'title': 'HRW: Yemen Houthis Disappear Dozens of UN, Civil Society Staff', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Yemenonline']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-19T02:11:05+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'f5627f46-e2de-5286-997c-ff861870a9b1', 'text': \"Russia is recruiting hundreds of Yemeni men to fight in Ukraine through a shadowy trafficking operation, highlighting growing ties between Moscow and the Houthi rebel group, the Financial Times reports . \\n The Houthi movement, officially known as Ansar Allah, is an anti-US, anti-Semitic Shia Islamist political and military organization that holds de facto control over most of northern Yemen. The movemenent attacks in the Red Sea target commercial vessels, including oil tankers, to disrupt trade and assert influence, using explosive-laden boats, naval mines, and alleged Iranian-supplied missiles. The Houthis have committed severe human rights violations, including child soldier recruitment, detainee abuse, forced marriages, hostage-taking, aid diversion, and repression of women and LGBTQ+ individuals, according to the UN and human rights groups.  \\nThe operation underscores Russia’s efforts to avoid full mobilization as casualties rise, with the country also recruiting mercenaries from Nepal and India, while some 12,000 North Korean regular army troops have arrived in Kursk Oblast for combat against Ukrainian forces, FT says. \\n \\nAccording to FT, the Yemeni recruits are promised high-paying jobs and Russian citizenship, but upon arrival are forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to Ukraine’s front lines with the help of a Houthi-linked company.

It was the Houthis who committed most quickly to support Hamas after October 7, including their dramatic October 31, 2023, launch of the first-ever medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) against Israel by a member of the Axis of Resistance, Iran included. (3) Among the axis, only the Houthis--formally known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), and (since February 17, 2024) once again sanctioned by the United States for terrorism (b)--have struck and sunk commercial ships in support of Hamas. (4) After a year of notable setbacks for the axis--loss of terrain and leaders by Hamas, (5) the deaths of Iranian and Iraqi commanders, (6) an underwhelming Iranian strategic strike on Israel, (7) heavy leadership losses for Hezbollah (including overall leader Hassan Nasrallah), (8) and now Israeli ground incursions into Lebanon (9)--the Houthis have arguably weathered the year of war without suffering major setbacks. \\n\\nThis study aims to update the April 2024 study in CTC Sentinel, (10) which looked in detail at the Houthi war effort against Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and global shipping from October 2023 to a data cut-off of April 11, 2024. (11) This article also builds on two other foundational CTC Sentinel pieces: the September 2018 analysis (12) of the military evolution of the movement and the October 2022 study (co-authored with Adnan Jabrani and Casey Coombs) (13) that provided an in-depth profile of the Houthi p0litical-military leadership, its core motivations, and the considerable extent of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah influence within the movement. \\n\\nThe sections below will take forward (to the time of writing (October 1, 2024, for news events, and an attack data cut-off of August 31, 2024)) the analysis of the military development of the Houthi movement. The analysis will draw on open-source reporting of Houthi military activities, which includes vast amounts of marine traffic analysis, social media, and broadcast media imagery, and U.S. and U.K. government announcements regarding military operations. The piece will also draw heavily on the collation and analysis work undertaken by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\\'s Maritime Spotlight platform, (15) which maps and analyses Houthi attacks on shipping, and the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC), run by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). (16) Some data has been drawn from contacts in Western naval and intelligence services, and from contacts in Yemen with extensive on-the-ground access in Houthi-held areas.\\n\\nThe article starts by summarizing the trends visible in Houthi military activities in the second half of the post-October 7 period, from April to September 2024. With the broad outlines set, a detailed analysis follows. Houthi military performance will be dissected in terms of the operational tempo of Houthi attacks, the geographic reach demonstrated in Houthi strikes, and the evolution of Houthi tactics and preferred weapons systems. Special focus will be directed at the issue of why the Houthis strike the ships they do, with a view to better understanding the real level of intentionality (or otherwise) in Houthi targeting of specific vessels. The article will conclude with assessment of the impact of U.S.-led military operations to protect shipping and an update to the April 2024 CTC Sentinel assessment of the Houthi movement\\'s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe overall trend in the Houthi war effort since the last CTC Sentinel analysis in April, and more broadly across the entire postOctober 2024 period, has been the successful continuation and improvement of Houthi attacks on shipping and on Israel. Despite the commitment of significant U.S., European, and Indian naval forces, the Houthi anti-shipping campaign was not suspended at any point. (d) Escalating U.S. and U.K. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen also did not end the Houthi anti-shipping campaign or even significantly reduce its operational tempo. (18) If anything, in the author\\'s view, the Houthis have arguably improved their effectiveness and efficiency as the war has progressed, by learning lessons and taking advantage of fluctuating U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea. In the manner of an underdog boxer trying to \\'go the distance\\' to the final bell, (e) the Houthis have shown resilience and resisted a superpower\\'s effort to suppress their anti-shipping campaign. The Houthis also weathered a heavy Israeli retaliatory strike on one of their two main port complexes and continued to attack Israel. If, as the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article assessed, (19) the Houthi aim is to vault to the front ranks of the Axis of Resistance by demonstrating fearlessness and pain tolerance in support of Hamas and in opposition to Israel and the U.S.-U.K. coalition, (20) then the Houthis have succeeded. From the perspective of Ansar Allah\\'s leaders, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis may see themselves as the main winners in the post-October 2023 conflict.\\n\\nAs the following sections will dissect in detail, the Houthis can claim to have maintained a broadly consistent operational tempo against shipping, with an apparent surge of effort in June and July 2024--precisely at the point that the U.S.-led international effort might have hoped the Houthi arsenals would be emptying and their pace of attacks reducing. (f) In this author\\'s view, as the below sections will outline, the resilience of Houthi domestic drone and drone boat production has been demonstrated, as has the movement\\'s line of supply to Iran-provided experts and resupply of irreplaceable Iran-sourced materiel. (21) As this article evidences below, many of the Houthi\\'s claims--of extended-range attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean or the Mediterranean--appear unfounded and perhaps deliberately falsified, but the Houthis have nonetheless spread growing fear that they can attack shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthi capacity to precisely identify, find, track, and strike ships by their owner\\'s nationality or ties to Israel may have been greatly overstated, but there are signs that the Houthis are gradually improving their targeting effort. In the author\\'s view (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the tactical sophistication of Houthi attacks is also steadily increasing from a very low initial base, aided by their ability to operate small boat flotillas in close proximity to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping lanes.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) from the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (22) it is sobering to note that assessed Houthi weaknesses--such as the technical deficiencies of their anti-shipping attacks and air defenses--may be less apparent now. Other exploitable Houthi weaknesses, such as their extended maritime line of supply to Iran and related smuggling networks, have not yet been effectively addressed by their adversaries. Regarding potential threats facing the Houthis, Iran has not been effectively levered into making the Houthis cease their attacks; nor has more united Yemeni opposition been aided to present a more urgent land warfare threat to the Houthis that might divert effort and attention from anti-shipping operations. As a result, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis can look back at the last year of war with satisfaction: Their position has strengthened, enemy countermeasures have been weathered, and they have no imminent threats on the horizon. This strongly suggests that the Houthis will sustain their anti-shipping and antiIsrael attacks as long as a Gaza and/or Lebanon war continues, if not beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthi military campaign has gone through some distinct stages since October 2023, often (but not always) reflected in the \"phases\" announced by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi. (g) The key trend has been a Houthi effort to sustain or increase their attacks on shipping and on Israel proper, despite obstacles such as U.S./U.K. airstrikes on launchers or the declining number of shippers using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (h) The liberal Houthi claiming policy, which either accidentally or deliberately appears to claim attacks that have not happened, (i) hints at their desire to maximize the apparent tempo, reach, and impact of their attacks. With a strong historic focus on propaganda operations, causing the impression of attacks may be as useful to the Houthis as the number of real attacks itself. \\n\\nAssessing how many attacks the Houthis have sent into the shipping lanes is an imprecise art because one must factor in both proven and strongly suspected completed attacks (evidenced by hits or near-misses on ships) (23) but also strongly suspected un-completed attacks (evidenced by the interception of inbound attacks by naval vessels in the shipping lanes). (k) Most collators of attack metrics versus commercial ships (such as JMIC and Maritime Spotlight) count only completed attacks on commercial ships. By slotting together JMIC incident data and other shipping data (collated by Maritime Spotlight) with the intercept data, one can gain a fuller picture of how many attacks the Houthis actually launch.\\n\\nFigure 1 includes the Maritime Spotlight-reported strikes on shipping, (24) fused with an additional set of intercepted attacks gathered in the author\\'s own dataset of U.S., U.K., and European-claimed interceptions in the shipping lanes. (25) Even then, these composite figures are probably a slight underreporting of actual strikes, as some attacks will be missed completely by collators, (l) and some attacks are disrupted in the launch phase by U.S. strikes (m) in Yemen but may be confused with strikes on storage sites where the weapons are not being readied for use against shipping at that moment. \\n\\nWith these caveats noted, the below statistics tell a story of relative consistency in Houthi anti-shipping efforts, with an upward step-change of attacks in the summer of 2024. (26) What the chart clearly does not show is a steady decline in Houthi attack activity in the face of international countermeasures--even during periods of constant U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea (November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024, and May 6, 2024, to June 22, 2024). (o) The percentage of completed attacks is 38 percent, averaged across the entire coverage period, with minimal variation across the period, suggesting a large proportion of intercepts (especially of slower-moving Houthi drones). \\n\\nAs well as wanting to be seen to sustain the tempo of their attacks, the Houthis also took pains to portray their geographic reach as ever-expanding. A new phase of claimed long-range strikes started in March 2024, with Houthi communiques threatening to strike out across the Indian Ocean basin as far south as the Cape of Good Hope off South Africa. (28) At the start of the Gaza war, there were two anti-shipping attacks on Israel-linked vessels in the eastern Indian Ocean: drone attacks on the CMA CGM Symi (November 24, 2023) and the Chem Pluto (December 23, 2024), both of which occurred closer to India than to Yemen and which may have employed Iranian naval and intelligence assets rather than Houthi ones. (p) Closer to Yemen, the Houthis did undertake three attacks on vessels at the eastern and southern edges of the Gulf of Aden: one near Djibouti (MSC Orion, April 26, 2024), and two east of Socotra (MSC Sarah V of June 24, 2024, and Maersk Sentosa, July 9, 2024). (29) A rash of claimed attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean by the Houthis appear to be erroneous or deliberately falsified. (q) A concatenation of these events put a chill on Indian Ocean shipping and resulted in some shipping lines taking longer mid-ocean routes to avoid the Yemeni and Horn of African littoral. (30) As has often been the case, an inflated perception of Houthi capability and aggressiveness may have achieved the effect the Houthis were seeking.\\n\\n\\n\\nHouthi attacks against Israel itself were never numerous and have become rarer as the war has dragged on. Direct Houthi attacks on Israel were most numerous in November 2023, with five attacks in that month following the first-ever MRBM attack on Israel by an \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member on October 31, 2024. Thereafter, Houthi-claimed direct attacks on Israel averaged just three per month in December 2023 to August 2024. \\n\\n (32) The Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) (33) began to jointly claim attacks on Israel from June 6, 2024, onward. (34) The IRI is an online brand used since October 2023 to gather together and anonymize the claims of Iran-backed militants in Iraq as they attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, purportedly in connection to the Gaza war. (35) From June 6 to July 15, IRI and the Houthis (the latter using the moniker \"Yemeni Armed Forces\") jointly claimed six long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, plus four attacks on Israeli onshore port facilities in Eilat, Haifa, and Ashdod. (36) These attacks appear to be servicing Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s May 3 instruction to commence the fourth phase of the anti-shipping war in which any ships interacting with Israeli ports should be struck--not only those closest to the Houthis in Eilat but also those interacting with Israel\\'s Mediterranean ports. \\n\\nAs is the case with more than 169 drone and missile attacks on Israeli land targets solely claimed by the IRI (at the time of writing on September 24, 2024), (38) it is almost impossible to verify that these Houthi-IRI launches occurred, (s) and it appears likely (based on multi-source analysis) that very few of the attacks reached Israel. (t) As attacks on shipping are more likely to be reported (via systems like JMIC), it might be expected that more evidence would exist of the six Houthi-IRI-claimed long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, (u) yet these also cannot be confirmed. (39) An earlier set of three Houthi-claimed (i.e., without IRI) long-range strikes on Israel-linked ships in the eastern Mediterranean in the May 15-29, 2024, period also do not correspond with maritime security incident reporting, casting doubt on the fidelity of the claims. (v) However, the June 30, 2024, killing of a mid-level Houthi officer (by a U.S. airstrike) at a drone or missile launch site in Iraq does lend additional credence to the claims of Houthi-IRI joint operations. \\n\\nWhile Houthi attacks on Israel have been sporadic and ineffective, they have occasionally been spectacular. MRBM strikes were launched on Israel on June 3 (41) and July 21 (42) (both on Eilat), and September 17. The latter case was claimed by the Houthis as the first MRBM (out of seven efforts) to penetrate Israel\\'s Arrow and Iron Dome systems, (43) with either a whole missile or intercepted debris falling in an area 15 kilometers from Ben Gurion airport and 25 kilometers from Tel Aviv--wounding nine people in this civilian area, (44) which neither Iran nor Hezbollah has attacked since the Gaza war started. (45) Though the MRBM was claimed to be a new \"hypersonic\" design by the Houthis, (46) there has been no Israeli or Western admission of a hypersonic attack, and it was more likely an extended-range supersonic MRBM such as the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar. (w) Since then, one more MRBM was fired by the Houthis at Israel (on September 27, 2024), again being intercepted. \\n\\nA final notable Houthi strike on Israel was the July 19, 2024, drone attack on the center 0f Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli civilian and injured at least four--once again, an action that neither Iran nor Hezbollah has dared to take since the outset of the Gaza war. (48) The drone, named Jaffa by the Houthis (the Arabic name for the Tel Aviv area) was an extended-range Iranian-made Sammad-3 drone. (49) The drone penetrated Israel\\'s battle-tested, low-level defenses by arriving from the west, over the Mediterranean coast, after apparently having taken a very long route via the African continent. (50) U.S. and Israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that it traveled via Eritrea, Sudan, and Egypt, thus avoiding the picket line of U.S. and European air defense vessels in the Suez area, and bypassing Israel\\'s own main southfacing defenses. (51) While the tactical surprise generated by the intricate and well-planned flightpath will be difficult to replicate, the incident demonstrated the higher-end of Houthi technical capability, potentially utilizing Iranian or Hezbollah route planning assistance, in this author\\'s view. In finding a new--but fleeting--way to penetrate Israeli defenses, the July 19, 2024, drone attack on Tel Aviv is reminiscent of the March 19, 2024, cruise missile strike on Eilat, (52) another \\'first\\' where successful penetration was enabled by elaborate route planning, that time via central Iraq and Jordan airspace. \\n\\nIsrael\\'s powerful counterstrike to the Tel Aviv drone attack--Operation Outstretched Arm, the July 20, 2024, destruction of a significant portion of the Houthi oil storage infrastructure at Hodeida (54)--was probably painful to the Houthis, as was the September 29, 2024, follow-on strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa ports. (55) However, these blows also (in the author\\'s view) brought the Houthis attention and recognition as the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member hitting Israel the hardest and in the most novel and spectacular ways. (56) The July 21 Houthi MRBM strike at Israel was one immediate response to the July 20, 2024, Hodeida strike, (57) and another was Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s statement the same day that the fifth phase of Houthi military operations in the current war would involve moving \"to a new level of anti-Israel operations.\" (58) He added that the \"Yemeni people are pleased to be in direct confrontation with the Israeli enemy.\" (59) A new September 27, 2024, MRBM strike on Israel drew a further September 29, 2024, Israeli strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa. \\n\\n\\n\\nSince November 2023, risk analysts, shipping companies, and insurers have all put a great deal of effort into understanding why the Houthis do or do not target vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (61) The Houthi clearly employ a kind of elective and selective targeting because only a tiny proportion of ships using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have been targeted. For example, there was still an average of 852 ships a month transiting the Bab el-Mandab in February to August 2024, (62) the level at which the Red Sea reset after an initial drop from pre-war levels of over 2,100 ship transits each month. (63) Of these 850-odd transits, (64) the Houthis have, in the most intense month of attacks in June 2024, completed or attempted attacks on only 4.9 percent of ships. (65) That means 95.1 percent of ships transited the Red Sea without being attacked in that month, (66) underlining the manner in which the Houthis have a very large universe of potential targets to choose from, even when the Red Sea is less busy.\\n\\nHow do the Houthis choose their targets out of this mass of ships?  \\n\\nAll of these categorizations require a degree of knowledge about the ownership, management, and vessel movement and port visits of commercial shipping. This data can be gained from open-source websites, but care and experience are required to differentiate between current and outdated information. As noted by Maritime Spotlight founding editor Noam Raydan, the Houthis appear to have started the war with knowledge about shipping lines and vessels that Iran had previously linked to Israeli owners and Israeli management--and which Iran had often targeted in the Persian Gulf in the 2019-2023 period. (71) To this short list, the Houthis also added new research on shipping assets linked to Israel and then (after January 12, 2024) also ships linked to the United States and the United Kingdom. (72) In the fourth phase of anti-shipping attacks undertaken since May 3, 2024, the Houthis will have needed to try to identify vessels not directly involved in Israeli trade but owned or managed by companies and individuals with apparent business in Israel or even personal connections to Israel. (73) The number of vessels tangentially linked to Israel, the United States, or the United Kingdom provides a very wide set of target options.\\n\\nThe broadening net of targets authorized by Abdul Malik al-Houthi has also included many Russian-linked and Chinese-linked vessels. (x) These great powers should, in theory, be well-positioned to negotiate safe passage due to their geopolitical alignment with the anti-Western \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' (y) yet they have both seen their cargos and vessels attacked repeatedly. (z) One reason may be the sheer availability of such targets: As the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted, nearly 74 percent of the southbound Red Sea oil traffic in the first half of 2023, (74) just before the war started, was made up of Russian oil cargos carried by the so-called \"dark fleet,\" often headed to East Asia. (75) As LNG tankers and major global shipping lines abandoned the lower Red Sea early in the conflict, (76) an even higher proportion of the remaining Red Sea transits was presumably (in the author\\'s view) made up by these smaller, costconscious, and risk-acceptant shippers willing to risk the journey. These same shippers have often, in the past, brought Russian oil to Israel, and are therefore perfectly valid targets from a Houthi perspective. \\n\\nJMIC statistics suggest that 14 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, were targeted because outdated ownership data triggered the extant Houthi targeting criteria. (78) In some cases vessels carrying Russian oil, notably Andromeda Star, have also been misidentified with consulted outdated materials as British-owned and attacked.  \\n\\nCan the Houthis Maintain a Target Lock?\\n\\nIf one problem is incorrect characterization of whether a ship meets the targeting criteria, a parallel problem is whether the Houthis have a sufficiently good ability to differentiate and track targets during an attack. If they do not, then it is very possible (in the author\\'s view) that they may undertake attacks on a certain ship but end up striking a different one. Quite a lot of evidence supports this theory. First, JMIC statistics suggest that as high as 37 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, did not meet the Houthis\\' own extant targeting criteria. (79) Second, the Houthis have struck Iranian ships (ac) and vessels that had recently left Houthi ports, (ad) or which were visiting Houthi ports, (ae) all categories of vessel that would presumably have a lower risk of being intentionally targeted.\\n\\nThird, the Houthis have frequently appeared confused about which ships they struck: (af) for instance, claiming hits on multiple ships on July 11, 2024, with no apparent knowledge of the presence of the only actual ship struck (the Russian oil-bearing Rostrom Stoic), or the unwitting Houthi targeting of a Saudi tanker, Amjad, on September 2, 2024, which the Houthis mistook for the Russian oil-bearing Blue Lagoon 1. (80) Fourth, the Houthis have sometimes claimed to hit ships that are not physically present in the targeted waterway: For instance, the May 7, 2024, claim to have targeted the MSC Michela in the Red Sea when the ship (and indeed all MSC vessels) are no longer using the Red Sea, and the Michela was instead in the Atlantic Ocean. \\n\\nTo understand how the Houthis \"find, fix and finish\" (ag) a ship, once they think they have identified a legitimate target, it is important to look at the sensors available to them. Wide-area surveillance giving a \\'common operational picture\\' of what vessels are visiting the Red Sea is mostly provided by ship-based transponders, the Automatic Identification System (AIS). (82) This system--available in simple form via non-subscription websites and in fuller form via subscription services--accurately maps all vessels in a maritime space with a velocity vector (indicating speed and heading), ship name, classification, call sign, registration numbers, and other information. (83) To reduce the risk of AIS being used to predict the location of a vessel (say, in the three to five minutes flight time of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) at 300 kilometers distance), (84) the UK Maritime Trade Organization advised from June 13 onward that vessels weigh the navigational and collision risks of turning their AIS off in high-threats areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and consider turning their AIS off when under attack and altering course in order to prevent their targeting by dead reckoning (i.e., projecting their future location due to their bearing and speed). \\n\\nAIS is likely not the only source of targeting information used by the Houthis, not least as the JMIC data shows that 13 percent of attacks have successfully struck a ship even when AIS was turned off. There are indications that long-range electronic intelligence (ELINT) is used by the Houthis to track ships, even those with their AIS transponders switched off. For example, JMIC guidance stresses the need to reduce \"non-essential emissions: other than AIS such as \\'intraship UHF/VHF transmissions.\\'\" (86) U.S. and U.K. naval officers privately confirm that the Houthis do listen in to bridge-to-bridge communications. (87) The United States and the United Kingdom seem to have tried to reduce Houthi ELINT capabilities: As noted in the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (88) the United States undertook multiple sequences of airstrikes in 2023 and 2024 on retransmission towers and GSM cell towers on high ground overlooking the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (89) Cellphone emissions close to shore may also be vulnerable to direction-finding, (90) not least because the Houthis control the key Yemeni telecommunications service providers, who are based in Sanaa. (91) It is also possible the Houthis have found ways to subscribe to commercial services that can triangulate terrestrial radio and combine it with AIS tracking. The Houthis are known to have received so-called Virtual Radar Receivers from Iran (92) that can create a targeting solution for aerial targets by fusing together open-source transponder and radio detection services. (93, ah) In the author\\'s view, the Houthis have probably already (with Iranian help) developed similar systems to combine vessel monitoring and radio direction-finding data.\\n\\nIn a final addition to this sensor network, the Houthis also probably utilize close-in sensors, such as surveillance UAVs, ship-borne AIS and radio monitoring, and visual scanning from boats. (94) At the outset of the conflict, the Houthis appear to have received radar and electronic intelligence steers from Iranian vessels (95) (such as Iranian frigates purportedly undertaking counter-piracy patrols, (ai) or various Iranian spy ships before they left the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by mid-April 2024).  \\n\\nBy achieving closer shadowing of target vessels (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the Houthis appear to be reducing the timein-flight limitation of their long-range strike systems (which can exceed 100 minutes for a drone flying 300 kilometers, during which time a ship can move by as much as 75 kilometers). (98) Houthi missiles and drones may carry terminal guidance systems--certainly semi-active radar homing for anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), (99) also electro-optical cameras in UAVs, (100) and possibly (though this is unconfirmed) some form of guidance system in some ASBMs as well. (101) The combination of wide-area surveillance, close-in target shadowing, and terminal guidance has allowed the Houthis to achieve some impressive feats of marksmanship, such as an apparent near-miss on a U.S. aircraft carrier (ak) and a number of hits or very close misses by ASBMs on ships approximately 150-200 kilometers from launch points. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe prior April 2024 CTC Sentinel study on the Houthi war effort in October 2023 to April 2024 provided an in-depth review of Houthi anti-shipping weapons--the Mohit and Asef ASBMs, the Al-Mandab-2 anti-ship cruise missile, a variety of fixed and delta-wing explosive-carrying UAVs, plus explosive drone boats (unmanned surface vehicles, or USVs). (102) This study will not repeat the lengthy profiles of these weapons and how they have been employed by the Houthis, only insofar as their mode of employment has changed significantly since then. The April 2024 study anticipated a gradual depletion of higher-end systems like ASBMs, but this did not manifest. (103) The following chart (Figure 2) shows numbers of projectiles detected by the author as having been employed by the Houthis in anti-shipping attacks since the end of April 2024. (104) Like all attack data, this is an imprecise art and is only meant to be indicative of the number of missiles, (am) UAVs, and USVs reported by coalition forces as intercepted during attacks, or reported by shippers impacting near or on vessels in proven attacks. Trends include the rise in attacks by explosive drone boats (USVs) in the summer; a more even spread of attack types; and a consistent drumbeat of UAV attacks, probably reflecting the relative ease of producing such systems inside Yemen. \\n\\nIn qualitative terms, the main change in Houthi anti-shipping attacks was the continual refinement of tactics regarding the combination of weapons systems. Three stages of development can be observed; in each case, the tactics were first applied in the Red Sea and then were extended to the Gulf of Aden. (106) The stages overlap and are not exclusive--in many cases, the Houthis mixed and matched older and newer tactics--but they do seem to have unfolded as a progression to more complex operations. \\n\\n After a brief period of failing to replicate the seizure of the Galaxy Leader, the Houthis commenced stand-off attacks in December 2023 to late May 2024, largely using either UAVs or ASBMs or cruise missiles but not a mix. (108) Accurate ASBM shots became regular in the Red Sea toward the end of June 2024 and continued through mid-July.  \\n\\n The Houthis appear to have begun mixing UAVs and ASBMs or other missiles in series of attacks on single vessels in the Red Sea from the end of May and into early June.  \\n\\nAll-systems, close-up, and stand-off. The third stage of development also overlapped the first two, manifesting first in the Red Sea, and was characterized by much greater involvement of Houthi small boat flotillas, typically including at least one USV. (109) These \\'hunter-killer\\' packs first targeted the bulk carrier Tutor in the Red Sea on June 12, causing the vessel to sink on June 18, only the second ship to be sunk (at the time of publication) by the Houthis. (110) The Tutor attack was notable for a successful \"tail-chase\" by at least one explosive drone boat that crippled the vessel, (111 as) followed by subsequent attacks on the stranded and abandoned vessel that may have included UAVs, ASBMs, and possibly demolition charges placed by Houthis on small boats.   (112) While evacuating the crew, a coalition naval vessel destroyed another nearby USV. Days later, while adrift and unguarded, the Sounion was boarded by Houthi commandos who set barrels of explosive on the deck and detonated them in a vivid videoed propaganda attack that demonstrated almost complete Houthi freedom of action. \\n\\nAs the author\\'s April 2024 CTC Sentinel article noted, the Houthis were extensively drilling their fast attack boat and USV flotilla between early August 2023 and the outset of the Gaza war in October, (114) probably related to rising U.S.-Iran naval tensions in the Arabian Gulf, where Iran had made six attacks on Israeli or U.S.-linked vessels between February and July 2023.  (115) Houthi naval commander Brigadier General Mansour al-Saadi had boasted in mid-December that around 80 such USVs had been stockpiled, (116) and this author\\'s April 2024 report noted that very few of these had been used at that time, but many have been subsequently employed in June-August 2024. (117) The Houthi flotilla utilizes fishing boats, islands, and even foreign coastlines (in Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia) as sustainment hubs, (118) exploiting restrictive coalition rules of engagement to merge within civilian traffic. (119) The Houthi flotilla has employed tactical drones, electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, and AIS trackers to shadow and report on target ships, (120) with periodic reports of them approaching or hailing vessels to confirm their identity. (121) Houthi flotilla are very rarely attacked and do not appear to suffer communication problems with the mainland. (122) This would seem (in the author\\'s view) to be from the Houthi perspective an ideal combination of forward observation and close-in attack options, backed-up by long-range strike capabilities that can now be assured of updated information on ship locations.\\n\\n\\n\\n For U.S., U.K., and E.U. naval forces, these operations arguably (in the view of the author) represent the most intense maritime trial-by-fire since conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Falklands.   (126)) The Houthis (and the broader Axis of Resistance) might achieve a significant propaganda boon if a U.S. vessel were badly damaged or sunk, and even the withdrawal of a U.S. carrier battle group from the Red Sea was loudly trumpeted by the Houthis as a victory. In the sphere of air defense, the Houthis have not come close to threatening U.S.-manned aircraft, but they have taken a heavy toll on the U.S. drone fleet, destroying at least nine MQ-9 Reapers between November 8, 2023, and October 1, 2024. \\n\\nThe United States and partner forces in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have clearly reduced the damage that the Houthis could do to global shipping, as evidenced by an assessed 62 percent interception rate shown in Figure 1 of this study. In addition to interception of launched attacks, the U.S.-U.K. air campaign over Yemen has undoubtedly limited Houthi capabilities to find and fix commercial ships--for instance, a determined effort to blind the Houthi targeting system with intensified strikes on Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) in June 2024. \\n\\nHowever, the reduction of U.S. naval presence in the Red Sea, particularly the withdrawal of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in late June, has arguably opened up the space needed for the Houthis to redeploy their small boat flotillas and recommence more effective wolf pack tactics. (127) Of note, naval assets do not appear to have been sufficient to guard the Tutor and the Sounion after they lost power and were abandoned, (128) allowing the Houthis to access these stricken ships. Houthi attack patterns in June and July appeared to show greater freedom of movement for their small boat and USV flotillas and an enhanced ability to follow and repeatedly attack ships. (129) In sum, in the view of the author, freedom of safe navigation has clearly not been restored by the efforts of international navies, respectable shippers have not been assured, and Houthi attacks are not deterred.\\n\\nEqually concerning, one of the greatest exploitable weaknesses of the Houthis--significant reliance on a maritime line of supply to Iran, for military resupply and for financing--has not been addressed by the international naval presence in the Red Sea. Whatever military supplies cannot be made entirely locally in Yemen--notably missile guidance, engines, fuel, warheads, and C4ISR systems (130)--has to be squeezed through the Houthi Red Sea ports or smuggled overland through enemy territory controlled by Yemen\\'s internationally recognized government. Yet, the policing of the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the Houthis seems to have slackened during the current conflict, not tightened, in the author\\'s view. At least six large ships have visited the Houthi-held port of Hodeida in 2024 without stopping for inspection, as required by a U.N. Security Council resolution, at the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) hub at Djibouti. (131) This is unusual behavior that only started in the spring of 2024 when the war was underway.  (132) Alongside the risk of large ship transfers, which are legally difficult to interdict as they require flag-state permission to board, (133) there have also been a trickle of large dhows and fishing boats entering the Houthi-held inlets south and north of Hodeida (which were detailed in the April 2024 article), (134) with around 12 ships subsequently docking there in May-August 2024, according to the author\\'s local contacts. (135) On June 26-27, 2024, the Houthis also managed to overcome the aerial embargo by diverting a Yemenia flight to Amman so that it instead landed in Beirut, Lebanon, and returned from there to Sanaa, Yemen. (136) What all this points to is the likelihood that the Houthis have been able to sustain their operational tempo--despite increased expenditure of munitions and U.S.-U.K. strikes--because they are being resupplied at an adequate rate.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT Analysis of the Houthi War Effort The April 2024 CTC Sentinel study issued an assessment of the demonstrated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the Houthis in the first period of their war against Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, and global shipping. As the war turns one year old, the picture is arguably even bleaker for the forces trying to contain the Houthi threat.\\n\\nThe strengths shown by the Houthis are abundant and have been reinforced by events: Their pain tolerance was illustrated by their apparent insensitivity to having at least a third of their oil storage facilities destroyed by Israel on July 20, which they answered immediately by firing a ballistic missile at Israel and vowing to double their efforts to strike the Israeli state. The strategic depth of Yemen--its size and mountainous terrain--had complicated the task of finding and destroying Houthi missile and drone systems.  \\n\\nSome weaknesses identified in April 2024 appear to have been partially addressed by the Houthis. One senior U.S. naval officer with responsibility for the Yemen theater told the author in mid-2024, \"We came to see that the Houthis are not a ragtag force: they are resourced, trained, funded, stocked, supplied, and resupplied.\" (139) As noted, the Houthi line of supply to Iran has probably strengthened, with no apparent cost for bypassing a U.N. inspection regime. (140) As outlined above, Houthi air defenses are gradually strengthening, albeit only against drones, and the technical weakness of long-range target acquisition and tracking are arguably being mitigated with new wolf pack flotilla tactics. As one U.K. naval officer with experience of the Red Sea operations told the author: \"Iran has excellent marine traffic intelligence; the Houthis don\\'t.\" (141) Yet, there is some evidence to suggest that the Houthis have learned how to offset this weakness and track intended targets. (142) As this author noted previously, the Houthis could not operate in proximity to strong Western naval forces in the Red Sea, but the thinning out of these forces offsets the Houthi weakness in tactical proficiency. The economic weakness of the Houthi regime was briefly exploited by the Yemeni government before being abruptly turned off by Yemen\\'s backers--Saudi Arabia, the United Nations, and the United States.\\n\\nMajor opportunities now beckon for the Houthis and the \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' with the Houthis arguably having delivered the best military performance of all the axis players in the current war, in the author\\'s view. There is strong potential for the Houthis to build on their successes in severely constricting one of the world\\'s busiest global chokepoints, the Bab el-Mandab. International shippers, insurers, and governments must be careful to ensure the Houthis do not learn how to effectively monetize their ability to shut the Bab el-Mandab and Suez Canal to selected nations or shipping companies, which can be levered into a lucrative extortion racket. (143) As Houthi targeting capability gets more selective, this terrorist threat finance risk may rise, unless it is actively monitored and deterred through sanctions enforcement.  \\n\\nThe Houthis\\' elevation to a top-tier member of the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' presents other opportunities to the whole Iran-led bloc. Under the Houthis, Yemen has become a place from which the Iran threat network can undertake attacks on Israel that Iran itself does not dare to mount--already including ballistic missile and drone attacks on Tel Aviv. (144) Yemen might also be used by the axis as a way to mount attacks on other targets--such as U.S. forces--in a way that may not draw retaliation on more pain-sensitive parts of the axis--for instance, Iran. At present, the Houthis have used the boogey-man reputation of hypersonic weapons as an attentiongrabber, but in the future, Yemen could be an ideal site for such weapons considering its geographic placement and its proven ability to conceal launch sites in its rugged interior.\\n\\nLikewise, the expansion of Houthi presence into areas like Iraq--where a senior Houthi missileer was killed by a U.S. strike on June 30, 2024--could put Houthi strike capabilities in new areas such as Saudi Arabia\\'s northern border, (bi) the Iraq-Jordanian border, (bj) and Syria. (145) Where Iran and its local partners can sometimes be fearful of the consequences of striking foes such as Israel or the United States, the Houthis may be more willing. This is particularly the case as key Iranian partners like Hamas and increasingly Hezbollah face severe military pressure from Israel. It is intriguing that a more visible Houthi presence in Iraq (146) seemed to coincide with the first use by Iraqi groups (under the IRI umbrella) of what the Houthis call the Quds-type land attack cruise missiles (LACM), known in Iran as the 351/Paveh. \\n\\nThe Houthi attacks in the southern Gulf of Aden--south of Socotra and toward Djibouti--hint at what expeditionary Houthi boat flotillas might accomplish one day, off the African littoral and even operating on the eastern coast of Africa in weak state environments like Sudan, al-Shabaab enclaves, and Somalia.  Imagine what a more effective capability could do, in the manner of the German merchant raiders that haunted the Indian Ocean in both world wars. (147) Addressing this threat more effectively will very likely be a priority issue for U.S. policymakers in the future, and one that the intelligence community will be called upon to support with analysis.\\n\\nThe Houthis could also view Russian military support as an opportunity. In a recent on-the-record address in Washington, D.C., the U.S. envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, was explicit about the risks of Russo-Houthi partnership, noting: \"Their relationship with Russia is extremely troubling... Russia is irritated by our strong policy on Ukraine, and they are seeking other outlets to retaliate, including in Yemen. They have been seeking to arm the Houthis, which would be a game-changer.\" (148) Lenderking was reflecting widespread press reporting of a potential Iran-brokered Russian supply of Yakhont/P-800 Onik anti-ship cruise missiles to the Houthis, which U.S. comments were probably intended to dissuade. \\n\\nPerhaps the only sharp threat facing the Houthis is the possibility that the Axis of Resistance writ large could suffer a crippling number of defeats in the current war--in Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere--and that Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah support to the Houthis might not be as available in the future as it has been in the past. For instance, Hassan Nasrallah\\'s death (150) removes one of the most ardent supporters in Lebanon of the Houthi cause, potentially disrupting a key relationship and potentially focusing Hezbollah on its own internal problems. Indeed, one wonders if the abundant manpower of the Houthis could provide a source of outsider regime security forces willing to crack down on local populations where Iran-backed groups are feeling pressure--such as Lebanon, Syria, and even Iraq or Iran. \\n\\nThis underlines the unusual potential finding that Iran itself may be more vulnerable than the Houthis. As U.S. Central Command\\'s General Erik Kurilla told Congress on March 7, 2024, the key to suppressing Iranian partner forces like the Houthis may come in the form of pressuring Iran itself to force the axis to back down (151)--a kind of inside-out approach in which Iran uses its soft power, its ideological leadership role within the axis, to convince a Houthi ceasefire (probably temporary) in the shipping lanes. If this turns out to be true, this would suggest that it may be easier to try to threaten \"the head of the octopus\" (152) (Iran) than to try to directly coerce its newest and most resilient and aggressive tentacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010), p. 189.\\n\\n(2) For a recent explainer on the axis, see Kian Sharifi, \"Iran\\'s \\'Axis Of Resistance\\': Different Groups, Same Goals,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, February 19, 2024.\\n\\n(3) Author\\'s geolocated incident dataset of the post-October 7 war.

So how foolish are we to engage in war with the arms when we could engage with the head?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Salmoni, Loidolt, and Wells note that the Houthis are known by a variety of names: \"the \\'Houthis\\' (al-Houthiyin), the \\'Houthi movement\\' (al-Haraka al-Houthiya), Houthist elements\\' (al-\\'anasir al-Houthiya), \\'Houthi supporters\\' (Ansar al-Houthi), or \\'Believing Youth Elements\\' (\\'Anasir al-Shabab al-Mu\\'min).\"\\n\\n(b) On January 19, 2021, the outgoing Trump administration designated the Houthi organizational institution Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), a step that the Biden administration almost immediately revoked on February 16, 2021. Since then, some Houthi leaders remained covered by older sanctions (and additional Houthi military leaders continue to be added to U.S. sanctions lists) for posing a \"threat to the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" Then on January 17, 2024, the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity but not as an FTO, a difference that enables easier access for humanitarian organizations and peace negotiators when the designation went into effect on February 17, 2024. For the newest SDGT designation, see \"Terrorist Designation of the Houthis: Press Statement by Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State,\" U.S. Department of State, January 17, 2024. For the prior sanctions, see \"Revocation of the Terrorist Designations of Ansarallah,\" U.S. Department of State, February 12, 2021. The U.S. government noted: \"Ansarallah leaders Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim remain sanctioned under E.O. 13611 related to acts that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" \\n\\n(c) One might look at the Israel July 20 attack on Houthi port facilities or the January 17, 2024, designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity as setbacks, but neither effort changed the Houthi behavior and the Houthis appear to have lost no senior leaders and no terrain since the war began, nor have they been notably economically damaged and the Houthi currency remains more stable than that of the internationally recognized government of Yemen. See \"The Economy,\" Yemen Review, April-June 2024.\\n\\n(d) There were two short pauses in Houthi anti-shipping attacks in 2024--April 9-24 and August 15-20--that are unexplained, though it is notable that these pauses coincided closely with periods of intense rain and flooding in Yemen, which tends to disrupt all military and non-military activities.\\n\\n(e) It is hard not to think of the movie boxer \"Rocky\" when looking at the fighting characteristics of the Houthis. Though this is charitable in the extreme--and does not reflect a sympathy for the Houthis--it is useful to view the Houthis in the Gaza war as an underdog boxer taking on much stronger opponents, whose aim may simply be to \"go the distance\" by supporting Hamas and the axis of resistance until the war ends (until the bell rings). Endurance and dogged pain aversion can be said to be characteristics of both the Houthis and the apocryphal Rocky Balboa.\\n\\n(f) This was the hope contained in this author\\'s assessment in his April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, which envisaged a triadic mechanism--increased usage and destruction of Houthi systems, compounded by tightened interdiction--slimming down Houthi arsenals.\\n\\n(g) The first phase, announced on November 14, 2023, called for attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea and on Israel proper. See Mohammed al-Harissi, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis vow to attack Israeli ships in Red Sea,\" National, November 14, 2023. The second phase, announced on December 9, 2023, declared Houthi intent to attack all ships headed to Israeli ports via the Red Sea. The third phase, announced after U.S./U.K. strikes on the Houthis on January 12, 2024, called for strikes on all U.S.- and U.K.-linked ships as well. Abdul Malik\\'s fourth phase was announced on May 3, 2024, broadened targeting to all ships whose owners or operators have visited Israeli ports. A fifth phase announced by Abdul Malik on July 21 was unclear in its expanded aims but seemed to focus more effort on Israel proper and its Mediterranean traffic and ports.\\n\\n(h) Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics suggest volume of shipping in the Red Sea dropped by 46 percent between November 2023 and February 2024, and has remained at these low levels since. Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics similarly suggest Bab el-Mandab transits dropped by 57 percent in the same comparison and stayed at this lower level since February 2024. Maritime Spotlight data; Lloyd\\'s List Intelligence presentation, August 9, 2024, provided to the author.\\n\\n(i) This study lists a number of cases in which Houthi attack claims do not appear to have been correct, notably attacks on the Mediterranean shipping and Indian Ocean vessels.  All the maritime attack case studies in this article draw upon the very useful Washington Institute Maritime Spotlight online tracker by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi.\\n\\n(j) In the author\\'s long study of the Houthi movement since the 2000s, a recurring feature is their keen eye for propaganda operations, about which the following listed authors dedicated entire chapters in their 2010 study. See Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010).\\n\\n(k) Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) also reports the interception of incoming attacks that are not counted by JMIC incident reporting. JMIC incidents are reported by shippers, who are not themselves witness to interceptions far away from their vessels. To give an example of the OPG intercept data, on September 24, 2024, a tweet released by @CENTCOM noted that \"U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed one Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicle over the Red Sea.\" See U.S. Central Command, \"Sept 24 U.S. Central Command Update: In the past 24 hours, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed...,\" X, September 24, 2024.\\n\\n(l) If JMIC and thus Maritime Spotlight are reliant on self-reporting of attacks by shippers, it stands to reason that some attacks will be simply not detected (neither intercepted nor landing close enough to a vessel to be noticed) or simply not revealed for some reason (perhaps insurance-related).\\n\\n(m) The United Kingdom takes part in Poseidon Archer planned joint strikes with the United States in Yemen, but it does not appear to mount preemptive \\'dynamic\\' (opportunistic) strikes on launchers ashore, which are all undertaken by the United States.\\n\\n(n) It is hard to tell sometimes whether a reported strike on a \"missile launcher\" is a preemptive U.S. action (as a missile is readied for launch, arguably counting as an \\'attack\\') or a strike on a storage site that cannot be considered an attack by Houthi forces. In the data collation in this piece, all such marginal or inconclusive cases are not counted as an attack.\\n\\n(o) Interestingly, the chart does appear to show a rise in Houthi attacks after the end of the extended presence of the USS Eisenhower and supporting escort vessels in the Red Sea from November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024. The Eisenhower returned to the Red Sea for a very intense period of Houthi attacks between May 6, 2024, and June 22, 2024, and there was no apparent downturn in attacks in that period. Since June 22, as later sections will detail (see \"Tactical Evolution\"), the Houthis seem to have exploited the reduction of U.S. presence. \\n\\n(p) On November 25, 2023, the Houthis claimed to strike an Israeli-linked container ship, CMA CGM Symi, in the Indian Ocean using a one-way attack drone, over 2,200 kilometers from the nearest Houthi-controlled area in Yemen. Considering the range, targeting support from Iran (in the form of the Safiz surveillance ship off the coast of India) is considered likely in this case. Details gathered from interviews with U.S. and U.K. military personnel for this study. \\n\\n(q) These include claimed attacks (all in 2024) on the Veracruz (April 24), MSC Vittoria 1 (May 7), MSC Alexandra (May 23), Aloraiq (June 1), and Anvil Point (July 1). \\n\\n(r) This includes all Houthi-claimed attacks launched either from Yemen or Iraq, which are likely to be comprehensive as the Houthis have a strong incentive to seek credit for such attacks. These Houthi-claimed attacks do not always result in confirmation of the attacks by Israel, particularly not when they are launched from Iraq. \\n\\n(s) The attack claims by IRI (including joint claims with the Houthis) often include videos of launches. The videos are not duplicated, being original each time, which is one indicator that attacks are genuinely being launched, but the lack of any supporting data means that it is still unclear whether all claimed attacks occur.\\n\\n(t) Very few Israeli press or government communiques give any insight into whether such IRI or IRI/Houthi-claimed projectiles reach Israel.\\n\\n(u) These are the claimed attacks on the Shorthorn Express (June 23), MSC Manazillo (June 26), Waler (June 28), the Ionnis (June 28), Lucky Sailor (July 1), and the Olvia (July 15). \\n\\n(v) These are the claimed attacks on the Destiny (May 15), the Essex (May 23), and the Minerva Antonia (May 29). The Essex, in particular, was quite far away from Israeli waters and docked at an Egyptian gas terminal at the time it was meant to be attacked near Israel. \\n\\n(w) The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) identified Houthi MRBMs used against Israel to be extended-range variant of the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar, known in Iran as Qiam/Rezvan. See the declassified dossier \"Iran: Enabling Houthi Attacks Across the Middle East,\" Defense Intelligence Agency, February 2024.\\n\\n(x) As many Chinese- and Russian-linked vessels have themselves visited Israeli ports in the past.\\n\\n(y) In the framework of great power competition, the Axis of Resistance clearly leans toward the non-U.S. bloc, led by China and Russia. In March 2023, Chinese and Russian diplomats reportedly sought Houthi guarantees that their shipping would not be hit in return for ongoing support to the Houthis in the UN Security Council.

If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024.

The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

In mid-October, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that the US struck the militant group using stealth B-2 bombers for the first time.

US forces in the region include a carrier strike group, several additional guided missile destroyers, an amphibious ready group, a marine expeditionary unit and a broad range of aircraft, including fighter and attack aircraft.', 'title': 'US carries out second consecutive night of strikes in Yemen, defense official says', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['CNN']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-11T06:17:39+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'e9571ed4-161b-524c-bb6d-25a72d47f6b5', 'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery region of the world, particularly the Middle East, has been alarmed by the increase in bloodshed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Opinion: Houthis’ rising threat', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Telengana Today']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-21T18:32:53+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'bdb10418-0874-596d-b2bc-a868cfa767f9', 'text': \"Two US Navy destroyers were attacked by the Houthis on Monday.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system.

This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry.

By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies.

Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes.

This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea.

Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

It means that for anyone planning a trip to this north African country, the Israel-Hamas war will be a key concern, especially as fighting has also intensified between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn October 26, Israel carried out military action against Iran. Dozens of fighter jets hit Iranian ballistic missile production facilities, missile launchers and air defence batteries in an attack that was codenamed “Days of Repentance”. The attacks were in retaliation to the events on October 1, when Iran launched around 180 missiles at Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had warned of “consequences” after the attack.\\n\\nBut while it’s geographically close to the conflict, the UK Foreign Office does not advise against travel to the main tourist areas of Egypt. However, there are large parts of the country that the UK Foreign Office does warn against travelling to. There are also safety considerations to bear in mind even when you’re travelling to the main tourist areas.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to the Middle East right now?\\n\\nWhat’s the latest government advice about travelling to Egypt?\\n\\nThere are no travel advisories in place for popular tourist spots in Egypt such as Cairo, cities along the Nile including Luxor and Aswan, and resorts by the Red Sea such as Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada. These are all considered safe by the UK government.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt on October 26 following Israel’s attacks on Iran. It warns ongoing hostilities in the Middle East could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai, which includes the crossing at Rafah, and within 20km of the Egyptian/Libyan border (excluding El Salloum, where it advises against all but essential travel).\\n\\nIt also advises against all but essential travel to the following areas:\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing US and UK strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, the Foreign Office said: “Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that travel advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor travel advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.”\\n\\nThis advice is still current and has not changed since the Iranian missile attack on Israel.\\n\\nSeparately, the Foreign Office has warned that terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, and targets could include destinations popular with tourists. Most attacks in the past have been in the North Sinai region, but they may take place in other parts of the country too.\\n\\nThe risk is heightened during public holidays and festivals, such as Christmas and Ramadan, and is particularly high around religious sites, large public gatherings and places frequented by foreigners. Stay vigilant and carry your photo ID with you at all times.\\n\\nHas Egypt been affected by the conflict in the Middle East?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn September 29, the UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt, saying: “Ongoing hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region. Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.”\\n\\nSharing a border with both Israel and Gaza has meant that Egypt is closer to the conflict than any other nation. On October 27, 2023, an official confirmed that a drone fell near a medical facility in the Red Sea resort of Taba, near the Israeli border, injuring six people.\\n\\nSeparately, two Israeli tourists and their local guide died after a police officer opened fire on a group of Israeli tourists in Alexandria on October 8, 2023, according to reports by the Israeli foreign ministry. This has not been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.\\n\\nMore generally, the Foreign Office warns that the border between Israel and Egypt at Taba could close at short notice. Visitors should check with local authorities before trying to cross. It also warns that since the Israel-Hamas war started, demonstrations (often at short notice) have taken place. Tourists should be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is currently closed. The Foreign Office says that when this border is reopened, Israel, Egypt and the authorities in Gaza may determine procedures for who is permitted to cross and when. Humanitarian aid workers cannot enter or exit Gaza through Egypt at this time.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to Israel right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Turkey right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Dubai right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Cyprus right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Morocco right now?\\n\\nIs Cairo safe?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Cairo and this advice has not changed since the US and UK joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, nor after the increased air strikes between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024.\\n\\nHowever, it’s a big and busy city so it’s still worth staying vigilant for petty crime. Female travellers should also take care — as in other parts of the country, harassment and sexual assault can and do happen.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nSharm el-Sheikh reopened to British tourists in October 2019, four years after a bomb exploded on a Russian plane carrying 224 tourists and crew. Security measures were increased at the Red Sea resort: x-ray scanners in hotels, security walls and high perimeter fences around the airport were installed.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office no longer advises against travel to the area of Sharm el-Sheikh. This advice has not changed since the US and UK launched joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen at the beginning of 2024.\\n\\nFor context, the attacks in the Red Sea have been limited to the south, while the Egyptian Red Sea resorts are in the north, more than 1,000 miles away.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Hurghada?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Hurghada, a popular Red Sea resort. Again, travel advice has not been amended for the resort following the strikes on the Houthi bases in Yemen, nor after the intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you drink alcohol in Egypt?\\n\\nEgypt is an Islamic country. While attitudes are more relaxed in tourist resorts, customs can be very different elsewhere and more strict during Ramadan. Public drinking, for example, can lead to arrest — alcohol is only permitted in a licensed restaurant or bar.\\n\\nPossession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs can lead to long prison sentences or even the death penalty. Visitors should be aware that what is legal in the UK may not be legal in Egypt. In 2017, for example, a British woman was jailed for three years for taking painkillers into the country. Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is a prescription drug in the UK but is illegal in Egypt.\\n\\nWhat about taking photos in Egypt?\\n\\nBe aware of what you’re photographing. Taking pictures of military installations (strictly prohibited), embassies, government buildings, churches and even infrastructure such as train stations can lead to arrest. If you want to photograph any Egyptian citizens, you must have written permission from them; photographing children is not permitted.\\n\\nTaking or sharing photographs that are perceived to be damaging to the country’s image is also forbidden. Similarly, making strongly negative comments about Egypt or its politics, including on social media, can lead to you being detained.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are Egypt’s entry restrictions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor entry into Egypt, you’ll need at least six months of validity on your passport. You’ll also need to apply for a tourist visa to visit most of the country. These can be obtained online before you travel or on arrival at dedicated desks inside the airport. This is valid for up to three months.\\n\\nIf you’re travelling to the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you can get a free entry permission stamp upon arrival for stays of up to 15 days. You’ll have to get a visa if you want to stay longer or visit other places.\\n\\nDo I need vaccines for Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nThere are no essential vaccine requirements for visiting Egypt. However, the NHS suggests that it’s advisable to have polio and tetanus jabs. You may also want to consider hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies and typhoid.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of safety on the ground, it pays to be vigilant. Protests take place frequently and foreigners taking part in political activities in the country could be detained or subjected to other measures.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office says: “If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the immediate area as the atmosphere could change quickly and without warning. Police have previously used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition for crowd control.”\\n\\nAt popular tourist spots, visitors can be harassed for money or to buy things. There’s also a risk of theft and mugging, even in taxis. Travelling as part of an escorted tour can help reduce the risks. If you are a victim of crime, you should contact the local tourist police who can help you make a report.\\n\\nPublic displays of affection can also be frowned upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for female travellers?\\n\\nIn general, yes, it is safe for female travellers. However, there have been reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment in the country, including some affecting minors. Most of the reported incidents have taken place in the Red Sea region and, according to the Foreign Office, are often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office advises: “Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.”\\n\\n What can women do to stay safe while abroad?\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for LGBT travellers?\\n\\nIt can be problematic for LGBT travellers. While homosexuality is not technically illegal in Egypt, according to the Foreign Office, the charges of “debauchery” and “sexual deviance” have been used to prosecute LGBT people in the past. Dozens of people were arrested in 2017 on debauchery charges after waving a rainbow flag at a concert in Cairo, for example. Again, attitudes are more relaxed in tourist areas but public displays of affection are likely to cause issues.\\n\\n Is it safe to go diving in the Red Sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Egypt travel advice: is it safe to visit right now?', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Burlington Times-News']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-10-26T11:32:14+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'ce38fd6e-5797-58d2-a684-bcdd25b14c1f', 'text': ' The arbitrary arrests appear to be based on the detainees’ present or past employment.\\n\\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, carried out these arbitrary arrests while widespread hunger and thirst remain rampant across Yemen, including in areas they control, and during a recent, major cholera outbreak that the Houthis hid for several months, based on ongoing Human Rights Watch research.\\n\\n“The Houthis are using arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances as a political tool at a time when the people living in their territories lack even the most basic needs,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should immediately release all of these people, many of whom have spent their careers working to improve their country.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch spoke to 20 people with knowledge of the arrests, as well as 4 Yemen analysts. Their identities are not being revealed for their safety, as they fear reprisals. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents, videos, social media, and media reports, voice recordings, and other materials relevant to the detentions.\\n\\nHouthi forces did not present search or arrest warrants at the time of arrest, and the authorities have refused to tell families where those arrested are being held, meaning that these acts amount to enforced disappearances. They have held detainees incommunicado, without access to lawyers or their families. On June 19, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Houthi human rights office with questions regarding the arrests and concerns about the apparent absence of any due process. The Houthis have not responded.\\xa0\\n\\nAs far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, no charges have been brought against the people detained. However, Houthi authorities have a long history of bringing dubious charges against detained people, including espionage.\\n\\nStarting on June 10, Houthi authorities released a series of videos and curated social media posts on the Houthi-affiliated TV channel, Al-Masirah, and its related social media platforms. These show 10 Yemeni men who were detained between 2021 and 2023. Most of them have been held incommunicado.\\n\\nThe videos show the men confessing that they were spying for the United States and Israel, but there is a high risk that these confessions were coerced. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain confessions. Publishing videos of confessions undermines the right to fair trial and lacks credibility.\\n\\nThough the Houthis have not said whether the current arrests are linked to the videos and their related announcements of uncovering a “spy network,” sources, including analysts, said that they feared that the Houthis were trying to frame the recently detained people as spies.\\n\\nYemen analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch also suggested political motives for the arrests. The Yemeni government-controlled central bank issued a decision on May 30 to end transactions with six banks within Houthi territories that refused to move their headquarters to Aden, which is under the control of the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The decision has the potential for a significant negative economic impact on Houthi-controlled territories. Analysts said that the arrests may be an attempt to put pressure on the Yemeni government to reverse the decision.\\n\\nEnforced disappearances, in which the authorities detain a person and then refuse to acknowledge their whereabouts or situation when asked, are serious crimes under international law and are prohibited at all times under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\\n\\nAll of the detainees are Yemenis. The Houthis have told families not to speak out about the detention of their family members, in many cases saying that detainees will be released as soon as the Houthis have completed their interrogations, as long as they do not find anything.\\n\\n“[The Houthis] know there will not be an [international] escalation from the arrest of the Yemenis, but if they arrested international staff there will be a huge escalation from the international community,” said one source.\\n\\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, have called for the release of all UN and nongovernmental organization staff, as have other senior UN officials.\\n\\nHowever, some sources also told Human Rights Watch that the UN agencies or organizations where detainees had been working had not made efforts to contact detainees’ families, including those living abroad who could have been safely reached.\\xa0\\n\\n“Continuing to work like business as usual cannot be done,” a source said. “The abductees that were part of the confessions yesterday, there was no huge demand for their release, barely anything was said by UN agencies,” referring to those shown in videos.\\xa0\\n\\nOne political analyst said that “he wider weak international reaction … proves that from [the Houthis’] perspective, they did the right thing.”\\n\\nIt is imperative for the United Nations, independent groups working in Yemen, and concerned governments to take every action in their power to ensure the release of those detained, Human Rights watch said. Oman, which has been a mediator in negotiations between the Houthis and other warring parties, should work with other countries collectively to ensure that the Houthis release the detainees.\\n\\n“The international community should be doing everything in their power to ensure that these people are immediately released,” Jafarnia said. “Many of them have been invaluable members of Yemeni civil society organizations and staff in UN agencies and nongovernmental international groups.”\\n\\nBased on interviews with informed sources, Human Rights Watch found that, starting on the morning of Friday, May 31, Houthi forces began arresting employees of several nongovernmental organizations, raiding their homes and offices, though a few arrests were before that date. According to one source, more than 60 people had been arrested as of June 12.\\n\\nIn one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children – a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old – of a woman who works with a civil society organization, a source said.\\n\\nIn all but one case, Houthi forces did not tell relatives where they were taking the person arrested, and none have had contact with their family members since they were arrested, as far as Human Rights Watch could determine. With the exception of one case, the authorities did not tell relatives where their loved ones have been detained when asked. Such conditions amount to enforced disappearance.\\n\\nOn June 18, Volker Türk said that the six staff members from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) who had been detained “have not had contact with their families, nor has the UN been able to access them.” In separate statements, he added that two other staff, who have been “held incommunicado, without any due process,” and two staff from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), had “already been arbitrarily detained for a lengthy period.”\\n\\n“I can’t even describe the fear and concern that all of these people had for their safety and well-being,” one source said. “[The head of one organization] couldn’t eat for an entire week.”\\xa0\\n\\nWhile the conditions of those disappeared remains unknown, many sources said that the Houthis had not allowed family members to send needed medicines for the detainees, including for serious medical conditions. Human Rights Watch has documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention since 2015.\\n\\nSince the initial raids and arrests on May 31 and June 6, the Houthis have continued arresting people, prompting many people in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to flee their territory.\\xa0\\n\\nOne person who left Sanaa said, “Although I managed to flee.… I couldn’t sleep … I’ve had panic attacks every day since I fled from Sanaa … I’m very worr[ied] about my friends and colleagues in Sanaa who are just waiting for Houthis to arrest them.”\\xa0\\n\\n', 'title': 'HRW: Yemen Houthis Disappear Dozens of UN, Civil Society Staff', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Yemenonline']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-19T02:11:05+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'f5627f46-e2de-5286-997c-ff861870a9b1', 'text': \"Russia is recruiting hundreds of Yemeni men to fight in Ukraine through a shadowy trafficking operation, highlighting growing ties between Moscow and the Houthi rebel group, the Financial Times reports . \\n The Houthi movement, officially known as Ansar Allah, is an anti-US, anti-Semitic Shia Islamist political and military organization that holds de facto control over most of northern Yemen. The movemenent attacks in the Red Sea target commercial vessels, including oil tankers, to disrupt trade and assert influence, using explosive-laden boats, naval mines, and alleged Iranian-supplied missiles. The Houthis have committed severe human rights violations, including child soldier recruitment, detainee abuse, forced marriages, hostage-taking, aid diversion, and repression of women and LGBTQ+ individuals, according to the UN and human rights groups.  \\nThe operation underscores Russia’s efforts to avoid full mobilization as casualties rise, with the country also recruiting mercenaries from Nepal and India, while some 12,000 North Korean regular army troops have arrived in Kursk Oblast for combat against Ukrainian forces, FT says. \\n \\nAccording to FT, the Yemeni recruits are promised high-paying jobs and Russian citizenship, but upon arrival are forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to Ukraine’s front lines with the help of a Houthi-linked company.

It was the Houthis who committed most quickly to support Hamas after October 7, including their dramatic October 31, 2023, launch of the first-ever medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) against Israel by a member of the Axis of Resistance, Iran included. (3) Among the axis, only the Houthis--formally known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), and (since February 17, 2024) once again sanctioned by the United States for terrorism (b)--have struck and sunk commercial ships in support of Hamas. (4) After a year of notable setbacks for the axis--loss of terrain and leaders by Hamas, (5) the deaths of Iranian and Iraqi commanders, (6) an underwhelming Iranian strategic strike on Israel, (7) heavy leadership losses for Hezbollah (including overall leader Hassan Nasrallah), (8) and now Israeli ground incursions into Lebanon (9)--the Houthis have arguably weathered the year of war without suffering major setbacks. \\n\\nThis study aims to update the April 2024 study in CTC Sentinel, (10) which looked in detail at the Houthi war effort against Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and global shipping from October 2023 to a data cut-off of April 11, 2024. (11) This article also builds on two other foundational CTC Sentinel pieces: the September 2018 analysis (12) of the military evolution of the movement and the October 2022 study (co-authored with Adnan Jabrani and Casey Coombs) (13) that provided an in-depth profile of the Houthi p0litical-military leadership, its core motivations, and the considerable extent of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah influence within the movement. \\n\\nThe sections below will take forward (to the time of writing (October 1, 2024, for news events, and an attack data cut-off of August 31, 2024)) the analysis of the military development of the Houthi movement. The analysis will draw on open-source reporting of Houthi military activities, which includes vast amounts of marine traffic analysis, social media, and broadcast media imagery, and U.S. and U.K. government announcements regarding military operations. The piece will also draw heavily on the collation and analysis work undertaken by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\\'s Maritime Spotlight platform, (15) which maps and analyses Houthi attacks on shipping, and the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC), run by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). (16) Some data has been drawn from contacts in Western naval and intelligence services, and from contacts in Yemen with extensive on-the-ground access in Houthi-held areas.\\n\\nThe article starts by summarizing the trends visible in Houthi military activities in the second half of the post-October 7 period, from April to September 2024. With the broad outlines set, a detailed analysis follows. Houthi military performance will be dissected in terms of the operational tempo of Houthi attacks, the geographic reach demonstrated in Houthi strikes, and the evolution of Houthi tactics and preferred weapons systems. Special focus will be directed at the issue of why the Houthis strike the ships they do, with a view to better understanding the real level of intentionality (or otherwise) in Houthi targeting of specific vessels. The article will conclude with assessment of the impact of U.S.-led military operations to protect shipping and an update to the April 2024 CTC Sentinel assessment of the Houthi movement\\'s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe overall trend in the Houthi war effort since the last CTC Sentinel analysis in April, and more broadly across the entire postOctober 2024 period, has been the successful continuation and improvement of Houthi attacks on shipping and on Israel. Despite the commitment of significant U.S., European, and Indian naval forces, the Houthi anti-shipping campaign was not suspended at any point. (d) Escalating U.S. and U.K. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen also did not end the Houthi anti-shipping campaign or even significantly reduce its operational tempo. (18) If anything, in the author\\'s view, the Houthis have arguably improved their effectiveness and efficiency as the war has progressed, by learning lessons and taking advantage of fluctuating U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea. In the manner of an underdog boxer trying to \\'go the distance\\' to the final bell, (e) the Houthis have shown resilience and resisted a superpower\\'s effort to suppress their anti-shipping campaign. The Houthis also weathered a heavy Israeli retaliatory strike on one of their two main port complexes and continued to attack Israel. If, as the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article assessed, (19) the Houthi aim is to vault to the front ranks of the Axis of Resistance by demonstrating fearlessness and pain tolerance in support of Hamas and in opposition to Israel and the U.S.-U.K. coalition, (20) then the Houthis have succeeded. From the perspective of Ansar Allah\\'s leaders, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis may see themselves as the main winners in the post-October 2023 conflict.\\n\\nAs the following sections will dissect in detail, the Houthis can claim to have maintained a broadly consistent operational tempo against shipping, with an apparent surge of effort in June and July 2024--precisely at the point that the U.S.-led international effort might have hoped the Houthi arsenals would be emptying and their pace of attacks reducing. (f) In this author\\'s view, as the below sections will outline, the resilience of Houthi domestic drone and drone boat production has been demonstrated, as has the movement\\'s line of supply to Iran-provided experts and resupply of irreplaceable Iran-sourced materiel. (21) As this article evidences below, many of the Houthi\\'s claims--of extended-range attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean or the Mediterranean--appear unfounded and perhaps deliberately falsified, but the Houthis have nonetheless spread growing fear that they can attack shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthi capacity to precisely identify, find, track, and strike ships by their owner\\'s nationality or ties to Israel may have been greatly overstated, but there are signs that the Houthis are gradually improving their targeting effort. In the author\\'s view (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the tactical sophistication of Houthi attacks is also steadily increasing from a very low initial base, aided by their ability to operate small boat flotillas in close proximity to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping lanes.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) from the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (22) it is sobering to note that assessed Houthi weaknesses--such as the technical deficiencies of their anti-shipping attacks and air defenses--may be less apparent now. Other exploitable Houthi weaknesses, such as their extended maritime line of supply to Iran and related smuggling networks, have not yet been effectively addressed by their adversaries. Regarding potential threats facing the Houthis, Iran has not been effectively levered into making the Houthis cease their attacks; nor has more united Yemeni opposition been aided to present a more urgent land warfare threat to the Houthis that might divert effort and attention from anti-shipping operations. As a result, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis can look back at the last year of war with satisfaction: Their position has strengthened, enemy countermeasures have been weathered, and they have no imminent threats on the horizon. This strongly suggests that the Houthis will sustain their anti-shipping and antiIsrael attacks as long as a Gaza and/or Lebanon war continues, if not beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthi military campaign has gone through some distinct stages since October 2023, often (but not always) reflected in the \"phases\" announced by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi. (g) The key trend has been a Houthi effort to sustain or increase their attacks on shipping and on Israel proper, despite obstacles such as U.S./U.K. airstrikes on launchers or the declining number of shippers using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (h) The liberal Houthi claiming policy, which either accidentally or deliberately appears to claim attacks that have not happened, (i) hints at their desire to maximize the apparent tempo, reach, and impact of their attacks. With a strong historic focus on propaganda operations, causing the impression of attacks may be as useful to the Houthis as the number of real attacks itself. \\n\\nAssessing how many attacks the Houthis have sent into the shipping lanes is an imprecise art because one must factor in both proven and strongly suspected completed attacks (evidenced by hits or near-misses on ships) (23) but also strongly suspected un-completed attacks (evidenced by the interception of inbound attacks by naval vessels in the shipping lanes). (k) Most collators of attack metrics versus commercial ships (such as JMIC and Maritime Spotlight) count only completed attacks on commercial ships. By slotting together JMIC incident data and other shipping data (collated by Maritime Spotlight) with the intercept data, one can gain a fuller picture of how many attacks the Houthis actually launch.\\n\\nFigure 1 includes the Maritime Spotlight-reported strikes on shipping, (24) fused with an additional set of intercepted attacks gathered in the author\\'s own dataset of U.S., U.K., and European-claimed interceptions in the shipping lanes. (25) Even then, these composite figures are probably a slight underreporting of actual strikes, as some attacks will be missed completely by collators, (l) and some attacks are disrupted in the launch phase by U.S. strikes (m) in Yemen but may be confused with strikes on storage sites where the weapons are not being readied for use against shipping at that moment. \\n\\nWith these caveats noted, the below statistics tell a story of relative consistency in Houthi anti-shipping efforts, with an upward step-change of attacks in the summer of 2024. (26) What the chart clearly does not show is a steady decline in Houthi attack activity in the face of international countermeasures--even during periods of constant U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea (November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024, and May 6, 2024, to June 22, 2024). (o) The percentage of completed attacks is 38 percent, averaged across the entire coverage period, with minimal variation across the period, suggesting a large proportion of intercepts (especially of slower-moving Houthi drones). \\n\\nAs well as wanting to be seen to sustain the tempo of their attacks, the Houthis also took pains to portray their geographic reach as ever-expanding. A new phase of claimed long-range strikes started in March 2024, with Houthi communiques threatening to strike out across the Indian Ocean basin as far south as the Cape of Good Hope off South Africa. (28) At the start of the Gaza war, there were two anti-shipping attacks on Israel-linked vessels in the eastern Indian Ocean: drone attacks on the CMA CGM Symi (November 24, 2023) and the Chem Pluto (December 23, 2024), both of which occurred closer to India than to Yemen and which may have employed Iranian naval and intelligence assets rather than Houthi ones. (p) Closer to Yemen, the Houthis did undertake three attacks on vessels at the eastern and southern edges of the Gulf of Aden: one near Djibouti (MSC Orion, April 26, 2024), and two east of Socotra (MSC Sarah V of June 24, 2024, and Maersk Sentosa, July 9, 2024). (29) A rash of claimed attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean by the Houthis appear to be erroneous or deliberately falsified. (q) A concatenation of these events put a chill on Indian Ocean shipping and resulted in some shipping lines taking longer mid-ocean routes to avoid the Yemeni and Horn of African littoral. (30) As has often been the case, an inflated perception of Houthi capability and aggressiveness may have achieved the effect the Houthis were seeking.\\n\\n\\n\\nHouthi attacks against Israel itself were never numerous and have become rarer as the war has dragged on. Direct Houthi attacks on Israel were most numerous in November 2023, with five attacks in that month following the first-ever MRBM attack on Israel by an \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member on October 31, 2024. Thereafter, Houthi-claimed direct attacks on Israel averaged just three per month in December 2023 to August 2024. \\n\\n (32) The Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) (33) began to jointly claim attacks on Israel from June 6, 2024, onward. (34) The IRI is an online brand used since October 2023 to gather together and anonymize the claims of Iran-backed militants in Iraq as they attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, purportedly in connection to the Gaza war. (35) From June 6 to July 15, IRI and the Houthis (the latter using the moniker \"Yemeni Armed Forces\") jointly claimed six long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, plus four attacks on Israeli onshore port facilities in Eilat, Haifa, and Ashdod. (36) These attacks appear to be servicing Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s May 3 instruction to commence the fourth phase of the anti-shipping war in which any ships interacting with Israeli ports should be struck--not only those closest to the Houthis in Eilat but also those interacting with Israel\\'s Mediterranean ports. \\n\\nAs is the case with more than 169 drone and missile attacks on Israeli land targets solely claimed by the IRI (at the time of writing on September 24, 2024), (38) it is almost impossible to verify that these Houthi-IRI launches occurred, (s) and it appears likely (based on multi-source analysis) that very few of the attacks reached Israel. (t) As attacks on shipping are more likely to be reported (via systems like JMIC), it might be expected that more evidence would exist of the six Houthi-IRI-claimed long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, (u) yet these also cannot be confirmed. (39) An earlier set of three Houthi-claimed (i.e., without IRI) long-range strikes on Israel-linked ships in the eastern Mediterranean in the May 15-29, 2024, period also do not correspond with maritime security incident reporting, casting doubt on the fidelity of the claims. (v) However, the June 30, 2024, killing of a mid-level Houthi officer (by a U.S. airstrike) at a drone or missile launch site in Iraq does lend additional credence to the claims of Houthi-IRI joint operations. \\n\\nWhile Houthi attacks on Israel have been sporadic and ineffective, they have occasionally been spectacular. MRBM strikes were launched on Israel on June 3 (41) and July 21 (42) (both on Eilat), and September 17. The latter case was claimed by the Houthis as the first MRBM (out of seven efforts) to penetrate Israel\\'s Arrow and Iron Dome systems, (43) with either a whole missile or intercepted debris falling in an area 15 kilometers from Ben Gurion airport and 25 kilometers from Tel Aviv--wounding nine people in this civilian area, (44) which neither Iran nor Hezbollah has attacked since the Gaza war started. (45) Though the MRBM was claimed to be a new \"hypersonic\" design by the Houthis, (46) there has been no Israeli or Western admission of a hypersonic attack, and it was more likely an extended-range supersonic MRBM such as the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar. (w) Since then, one more MRBM was fired by the Houthis at Israel (on September 27, 2024), again being intercepted. \\n\\nA final notable Houthi strike on Israel was the July 19, 2024, drone attack on the center 0f Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli civilian and injured at least four--once again, an action that neither Iran nor Hezbollah has dared to take since the outset of the Gaza war. (48) The drone, named Jaffa by the Houthis (the Arabic name for the Tel Aviv area) was an extended-range Iranian-made Sammad-3 drone. (49) The drone penetrated Israel\\'s battle-tested, low-level defenses by arriving from the west, over the Mediterranean coast, after apparently having taken a very long route via the African continent. (50) U.S. and Israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that it traveled via Eritrea, Sudan, and Egypt, thus avoiding the picket line of U.S. and European air defense vessels in the Suez area, and bypassing Israel\\'s own main southfacing defenses. (51) While the tactical surprise generated by the intricate and well-planned flightpath will be difficult to replicate, the incident demonstrated the higher-end of Houthi technical capability, potentially utilizing Iranian or Hezbollah route planning assistance, in this author\\'s view. In finding a new--but fleeting--way to penetrate Israeli defenses, the July 19, 2024, drone attack on Tel Aviv is reminiscent of the March 19, 2024, cruise missile strike on Eilat, (52) another \\'first\\' where successful penetration was enabled by elaborate route planning, that time via central Iraq and Jordan airspace. \\n\\nIsrael\\'s powerful counterstrike to the Tel Aviv drone attack--Operation Outstretched Arm, the July 20, 2024, destruction of a significant portion of the Houthi oil storage infrastructure at Hodeida (54)--was probably painful to the Houthis, as was the September 29, 2024, follow-on strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa ports. (55) However, these blows also (in the author\\'s view) brought the Houthis attention and recognition as the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member hitting Israel the hardest and in the most novel and spectacular ways. (56) The July 21 Houthi MRBM strike at Israel was one immediate response to the July 20, 2024, Hodeida strike, (57) and another was Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s statement the same day that the fifth phase of Houthi military operations in the current war would involve moving \"to a new level of anti-Israel operations.\" (58) He added that the \"Yemeni people are pleased to be in direct confrontation with the Israeli enemy.\" (59) A new September 27, 2024, MRBM strike on Israel drew a further September 29, 2024, Israeli strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa. \\n\\n\\n\\nSince November 2023, risk analysts, shipping companies, and insurers have all put a great deal of effort into understanding why the Houthis do or do not target vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (61) The Houthi clearly employ a kind of elective and selective targeting because only a tiny proportion of ships using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have been targeted. For example, there was still an average of 852 ships a month transiting the Bab el-Mandab in February to August 2024, (62) the level at which the Red Sea reset after an initial drop from pre-war levels of over 2,100 ship transits each month. (63) Of these 850-odd transits, (64) the Houthis have, in the most intense month of attacks in June 2024, completed or attempted attacks on only 4.9 percent of ships. (65) That means 95.1 percent of ships transited the Red Sea without being attacked in that month, (66) underlining the manner in which the Houthis have a very large universe of potential targets to choose from, even when the Red Sea is less busy.\\n\\nHow do the Houthis choose their targets out of this mass of ships?  \\n\\nAll of these categorizations require a degree of knowledge about the ownership, management, and vessel movement and port visits of commercial shipping. This data can be gained from open-source websites, but care and experience are required to differentiate between current and outdated information. As noted by Maritime Spotlight founding editor Noam Raydan, the Houthis appear to have started the war with knowledge about shipping lines and vessels that Iran had previously linked to Israeli owners and Israeli management--and which Iran had often targeted in the Persian Gulf in the 2019-2023 period. (71) To this short list, the Houthis also added new research on shipping assets linked to Israel and then (after January 12, 2024) also ships linked to the United States and the United Kingdom. (72) In the fourth phase of anti-shipping attacks undertaken since May 3, 2024, the Houthis will have needed to try to identify vessels not directly involved in Israeli trade but owned or managed by companies and individuals with apparent business in Israel or even personal connections to Israel. (73) The number of vessels tangentially linked to Israel, the United States, or the United Kingdom provides a very wide set of target options.\\n\\nThe broadening net of targets authorized by Abdul Malik al-Houthi has also included many Russian-linked and Chinese-linked vessels. (x) These great powers should, in theory, be well-positioned to negotiate safe passage due to their geopolitical alignment with the anti-Western \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' (y) yet they have both seen their cargos and vessels attacked repeatedly. (z) One reason may be the sheer availability of such targets: As the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted, nearly 74 percent of the southbound Red Sea oil traffic in the first half of 2023, (74) just before the war started, was made up of Russian oil cargos carried by the so-called \"dark fleet,\" often headed to East Asia. (75) As LNG tankers and major global shipping lines abandoned the lower Red Sea early in the conflict, (76) an even higher proportion of the remaining Red Sea transits was presumably (in the author\\'s view) made up by these smaller, costconscious, and risk-acceptant shippers willing to risk the journey. These same shippers have often, in the past, brought Russian oil to Israel, and are therefore perfectly valid targets from a Houthi perspective. \\n\\nJMIC statistics suggest that 14 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, were targeted because outdated ownership data triggered the extant Houthi targeting criteria. (78) In some cases vessels carrying Russian oil, notably Andromeda Star, have also been misidentified with consulted outdated materials as British-owned and attacked.  \\n\\nCan the Houthis Maintain a Target Lock?\\n\\nIf one problem is incorrect characterization of whether a ship meets the targeting criteria, a parallel problem is whether the Houthis have a sufficiently good ability to differentiate and track targets during an attack. If they do not, then it is very possible (in the author\\'s view) that they may undertake attacks on a certain ship but end up striking a different one. Quite a lot of evidence supports this theory. First, JMIC statistics suggest that as high as 37 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, did not meet the Houthis\\' own extant targeting criteria. (79) Second, the Houthis have struck Iranian ships (ac) and vessels that had recently left Houthi ports, (ad) or which were visiting Houthi ports, (ae) all categories of vessel that would presumably have a lower risk of being intentionally targeted.\\n\\nThird, the Houthis have frequently appeared confused about which ships they struck: (af) for instance, claiming hits on multiple ships on July 11, 2024, with no apparent knowledge of the presence of the only actual ship struck (the Russian oil-bearing Rostrom Stoic), or the unwitting Houthi targeting of a Saudi tanker, Amjad, on September 2, 2024, which the Houthis mistook for the Russian oil-bearing Blue Lagoon 1. (80) Fourth, the Houthis have sometimes claimed to hit ships that are not physically present in the targeted waterway: For instance, the May 7, 2024, claim to have targeted the MSC Michela in the Red Sea when the ship (and indeed all MSC vessels) are no longer using the Red Sea, and the Michela was instead in the Atlantic Ocean. \\n\\nTo understand how the Houthis \"find, fix and finish\" (ag) a ship, once they think they have identified a legitimate target, it is important to look at the sensors available to them. Wide-area surveillance giving a \\'common operational picture\\' of what vessels are visiting the Red Sea is mostly provided by ship-based transponders, the Automatic Identification System (AIS). (82) This system--available in simple form via non-subscription websites and in fuller form via subscription services--accurately maps all vessels in a maritime space with a velocity vector (indicating speed and heading), ship name, classification, call sign, registration numbers, and other information. (83) To reduce the risk of AIS being used to predict the location of a vessel (say, in the three to five minutes flight time of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) at 300 kilometers distance), (84) the UK Maritime Trade Organization advised from June 13 onward that vessels weigh the navigational and collision risks of turning their AIS off in high-threats areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and consider turning their AIS off when under attack and altering course in order to prevent their targeting by dead reckoning (i.e., projecting their future location due to their bearing and speed). \\n\\nAIS is likely not the only source of targeting information used by the Houthis, not least as the JMIC data shows that 13 percent of attacks have successfully struck a ship even when AIS was turned off. There are indications that long-range electronic intelligence (ELINT) is used by the Houthis to track ships, even those with their AIS transponders switched off. For example, JMIC guidance stresses the need to reduce \"non-essential emissions: other than AIS such as \\'intraship UHF/VHF transmissions.\\'\" (86) U.S. and U.K. naval officers privately confirm that the Houthis do listen in to bridge-to-bridge communications. (87) The United States and the United Kingdom seem to have tried to reduce Houthi ELINT capabilities: As noted in the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (88) the United States undertook multiple sequences of airstrikes in 2023 and 2024 on retransmission towers and GSM cell towers on high ground overlooking the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (89) Cellphone emissions close to shore may also be vulnerable to direction-finding, (90) not least because the Houthis control the key Yemeni telecommunications service providers, who are based in Sanaa. (91) It is also possible the Houthis have found ways to subscribe to commercial services that can triangulate terrestrial radio and combine it with AIS tracking. The Houthis are known to have received so-called Virtual Radar Receivers from Iran (92) that can create a targeting solution for aerial targets by fusing together open-source transponder and radio detection services. (93, ah) In the author\\'s view, the Houthis have probably already (with Iranian help) developed similar systems to combine vessel monitoring and radio direction-finding data.\\n\\nIn a final addition to this sensor network, the Houthis also probably utilize close-in sensors, such as surveillance UAVs, ship-borne AIS and radio monitoring, and visual scanning from boats. (94) At the outset of the conflict, the Houthis appear to have received radar and electronic intelligence steers from Iranian vessels (95) (such as Iranian frigates purportedly undertaking counter-piracy patrols, (ai) or various Iranian spy ships before they left the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by mid-April 2024).  \\n\\nBy achieving closer shadowing of target vessels (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the Houthis appear to be reducing the timein-flight limitation of their long-range strike systems (which can exceed 100 minutes for a drone flying 300 kilometers, during which time a ship can move by as much as 75 kilometers). (98) Houthi missiles and drones may carry terminal guidance systems--certainly semi-active radar homing for anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), (99) also electro-optical cameras in UAVs, (100) and possibly (though this is unconfirmed) some form of guidance system in some ASBMs as well. (101) The combination of wide-area surveillance, close-in target shadowing, and terminal guidance has allowed the Houthis to achieve some impressive feats of marksmanship, such as an apparent near-miss on a U.S. aircraft carrier (ak) and a number of hits or very close misses by ASBMs on ships approximately 150-200 kilometers from launch points. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe prior April 2024 CTC Sentinel study on the Houthi war effort in October 2023 to April 2024 provided an in-depth review of Houthi anti-shipping weapons--the Mohit and Asef ASBMs, the Al-Mandab-2 anti-ship cruise missile, a variety of fixed and delta-wing explosive-carrying UAVs, plus explosive drone boats (unmanned surface vehicles, or USVs). (102) This study will not repeat the lengthy profiles of these weapons and how they have been employed by the Houthis, only insofar as their mode of employment has changed significantly since then. The April 2024 study anticipated a gradual depletion of higher-end systems like ASBMs, but this did not manifest. (103) The following chart (Figure 2) shows numbers of projectiles detected by the author as having been employed by the Houthis in anti-shipping attacks since the end of April 2024. (104) Like all attack data, this is an imprecise art and is only meant to be indicative of the number of missiles, (am) UAVs, and USVs reported by coalition forces as intercepted during attacks, or reported by shippers impacting near or on vessels in proven attacks. Trends include the rise in attacks by explosive drone boats (USVs) in the summer; a more even spread of attack types; and a consistent drumbeat of UAV attacks, probably reflecting the relative ease of producing such systems inside Yemen. \\n\\nIn qualitative terms, the main change in Houthi anti-shipping attacks was the continual refinement of tactics regarding the combination of weapons systems. Three stages of development can be observed; in each case, the tactics were first applied in the Red Sea and then were extended to the Gulf of Aden. (106) The stages overlap and are not exclusive--in many cases, the Houthis mixed and matched older and newer tactics--but they do seem to have unfolded as a progression to more complex operations. \\n\\n After a brief period of failing to replicate the seizure of the Galaxy Leader, the Houthis commenced stand-off attacks in December 2023 to late May 2024, largely using either UAVs or ASBMs or cruise missiles but not a mix. (108) Accurate ASBM shots became regular in the Red Sea toward the end of June 2024 and continued through mid-July.  \\n\\n The Houthis appear to have begun mixing UAVs and ASBMs or other missiles in series of attacks on single vessels in the Red Sea from the end of May and into early June.  \\n\\nAll-systems, close-up, and stand-off. The third stage of development also overlapped the first two, manifesting first in the Red Sea, and was characterized by much greater involvement of Houthi small boat flotillas, typically including at least one USV. (109) These \\'hunter-killer\\' packs first targeted the bulk carrier Tutor in the Red Sea on June 12, causing the vessel to sink on June 18, only the second ship to be sunk (at the time of publication) by the Houthis. (110) The Tutor attack was notable for a successful \"tail-chase\" by at least one explosive drone boat that crippled the vessel, (111 as) followed by subsequent attacks on the stranded and abandoned vessel that may have included UAVs, ASBMs, and possibly demolition charges placed by Houthis on small boats.   (112) While evacuating the crew, a coalition naval vessel destroyed another nearby USV. Days later, while adrift and unguarded, the Sounion was boarded by Houthi commandos who set barrels of explosive on the deck and detonated them in a vivid videoed propaganda attack that demonstrated almost complete Houthi freedom of action. \\n\\nAs the author\\'s April 2024 CTC Sentinel article noted, the Houthis were extensively drilling their fast attack boat and USV flotilla between early August 2023 and the outset of the Gaza war in October, (114) probably related to rising U.S.-Iran naval tensions in the Arabian Gulf, where Iran had made six attacks on Israeli or U.S.-linked vessels between February and July 2023.  (115) Houthi naval commander Brigadier General Mansour al-Saadi had boasted in mid-December that around 80 such USVs had been stockpiled, (116) and this author\\'s April 2024 report noted that very few of these had been used at that time, but many have been subsequently employed in June-August 2024. (117) The Houthi flotilla utilizes fishing boats, islands, and even foreign coastlines (in Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia) as sustainment hubs, (118) exploiting restrictive coalition rules of engagement to merge within civilian traffic. (119) The Houthi flotilla has employed tactical drones, electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, and AIS trackers to shadow and report on target ships, (120) with periodic reports of them approaching or hailing vessels to confirm their identity. (121) Houthi flotilla are very rarely attacked and do not appear to suffer communication problems with the mainland. (122) This would seem (in the author\\'s view) to be from the Houthi perspective an ideal combination of forward observation and close-in attack options, backed-up by long-range strike capabilities that can now be assured of updated information on ship locations.\\n\\n\\n\\n For U.S., U.K., and E.U. naval forces, these operations arguably (in the view of the author) represent the most intense maritime trial-by-fire since conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Falklands.   (126)) The Houthis (and the broader Axis of Resistance) might achieve a significant propaganda boon if a U.S. vessel were badly damaged or sunk, and even the withdrawal of a U.S. carrier battle group from the Red Sea was loudly trumpeted by the Houthis as a victory. In the sphere of air defense, the Houthis have not come close to threatening U.S.-manned aircraft, but they have taken a heavy toll on the U.S. drone fleet, destroying at least nine MQ-9 Reapers between November 8, 2023, and October 1, 2024. \\n\\nThe United States and partner forces in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have clearly reduced the damage that the Houthis could do to global shipping, as evidenced by an assessed 62 percent interception rate shown in Figure 1 of this study. In addition to interception of launched attacks, the U.S.-U.K. air campaign over Yemen has undoubtedly limited Houthi capabilities to find and fix commercial ships--for instance, a determined effort to blind the Houthi targeting system with intensified strikes on Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) in June 2024. \\n\\nHowever, the reduction of U.S. naval presence in the Red Sea, particularly the withdrawal of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in late June, has arguably opened up the space needed for the Houthis to redeploy their small boat flotillas and recommence more effective wolf pack tactics. (127) Of note, naval assets do not appear to have been sufficient to guard the Tutor and the Sounion after they lost power and were abandoned, (128) allowing the Houthis to access these stricken ships. Houthi attack patterns in June and July appeared to show greater freedom of movement for their small boat and USV flotillas and an enhanced ability to follow and repeatedly attack ships. (129) In sum, in the view of the author, freedom of safe navigation has clearly not been restored by the efforts of international navies, respectable shippers have not been assured, and Houthi attacks are not deterred.\\n\\nEqually concerning, one of the greatest exploitable weaknesses of the Houthis--significant reliance on a maritime line of supply to Iran, for military resupply and for financing--has not been addressed by the international naval presence in the Red Sea. Whatever military supplies cannot be made entirely locally in Yemen--notably missile guidance, engines, fuel, warheads, and C4ISR systems (130)--has to be squeezed through the Houthi Red Sea ports or smuggled overland through enemy territory controlled by Yemen\\'s internationally recognized government. Yet, the policing of the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the Houthis seems to have slackened during the current conflict, not tightened, in the author\\'s view. At least six large ships have visited the Houthi-held port of Hodeida in 2024 without stopping for inspection, as required by a U.N. Security Council resolution, at the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) hub at Djibouti. (131) This is unusual behavior that only started in the spring of 2024 when the war was underway.  (132) Alongside the risk of large ship transfers, which are legally difficult to interdict as they require flag-state permission to board, (133) there have also been a trickle of large dhows and fishing boats entering the Houthi-held inlets south and north of Hodeida (which were detailed in the April 2024 article), (134) with around 12 ships subsequently docking there in May-August 2024, according to the author\\'s local contacts. (135) On June 26-27, 2024, the Houthis also managed to overcome the aerial embargo by diverting a Yemenia flight to Amman so that it instead landed in Beirut, Lebanon, and returned from there to Sanaa, Yemen. (136) What all this points to is the likelihood that the Houthis have been able to sustain their operational tempo--despite increased expenditure of munitions and U.S.-U.K. strikes--because they are being resupplied at an adequate rate.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT Analysis of the Houthi War Effort The April 2024 CTC Sentinel study issued an assessment of the demonstrated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the Houthis in the first period of their war against Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, and global shipping. As the war turns one year old, the picture is arguably even bleaker for the forces trying to contain the Houthi threat.\\n\\nThe strengths shown by the Houthis are abundant and have been reinforced by events: Their pain tolerance was illustrated by their apparent insensitivity to having at least a third of their oil storage facilities destroyed by Israel on July 20, which they answered immediately by firing a ballistic missile at Israel and vowing to double their efforts to strike the Israeli state. The strategic depth of Yemen--its size and mountainous terrain--had complicated the task of finding and destroying Houthi missile and drone systems.  \\n\\nSome weaknesses identified in April 2024 appear to have been partially addressed by the Houthis. One senior U.S. naval officer with responsibility for the Yemen theater told the author in mid-2024, \"We came to see that the Houthis are not a ragtag force: they are resourced, trained, funded, stocked, supplied, and resupplied.\" (139) As noted, the Houthi line of supply to Iran has probably strengthened, with no apparent cost for bypassing a U.N. inspection regime. (140) As outlined above, Houthi air defenses are gradually strengthening, albeit only against drones, and the technical weakness of long-range target acquisition and tracking are arguably being mitigated with new wolf pack flotilla tactics. As one U.K. naval officer with experience of the Red Sea operations told the author: \"Iran has excellent marine traffic intelligence; the Houthis don\\'t.\" (141) Yet, there is some evidence to suggest that the Houthis have learned how to offset this weakness and track intended targets. (142) As this author noted previously, the Houthis could not operate in proximity to strong Western naval forces in the Red Sea, but the thinning out of these forces offsets the Houthi weakness in tactical proficiency. The economic weakness of the Houthi regime was briefly exploited by the Yemeni government before being abruptly turned off by Yemen\\'s backers--Saudi Arabia, the United Nations, and the United States.\\n\\nMajor opportunities now beckon for the Houthis and the \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' with the Houthis arguably having delivered the best military performance of all the axis players in the current war, in the author\\'s view. There is strong potential for the Houthis to build on their successes in severely constricting one of the world\\'s busiest global chokepoints, the Bab el-Mandab. International shippers, insurers, and governments must be careful to ensure the Houthis do not learn how to effectively monetize their ability to shut the Bab el-Mandab and Suez Canal to selected nations or shipping companies, which can be levered into a lucrative extortion racket. (143) As Houthi targeting capability gets more selective, this terrorist threat finance risk may rise, unless it is actively monitored and deterred through sanctions enforcement.  \\n\\nThe Houthis\\' elevation to a top-tier member of the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' presents other opportunities to the whole Iran-led bloc. Under the Houthis, Yemen has become a place from which the Iran threat network can undertake attacks on Israel that Iran itself does not dare to mount--already including ballistic missile and drone attacks on Tel Aviv. (144) Yemen might also be used by the axis as a way to mount attacks on other targets--such as U.S. forces--in a way that may not draw retaliation on more pain-sensitive parts of the axis--for instance, Iran. At present, the Houthis have used the boogey-man reputation of hypersonic weapons as an attentiongrabber, but in the future, Yemen could be an ideal site for such weapons considering its geographic placement and its proven ability to conceal launch sites in its rugged interior.\\n\\nLikewise, the expansion of Houthi presence into areas like Iraq--where a senior Houthi missileer was killed by a U.S. strike on June 30, 2024--could put Houthi strike capabilities in new areas such as Saudi Arabia\\'s northern border, (bi) the Iraq-Jordanian border, (bj) and Syria. (145) Where Iran and its local partners can sometimes be fearful of the consequences of striking foes such as Israel or the United States, the Houthis may be more willing. This is particularly the case as key Iranian partners like Hamas and increasingly Hezbollah face severe military pressure from Israel. It is intriguing that a more visible Houthi presence in Iraq (146) seemed to coincide with the first use by Iraqi groups (under the IRI umbrella) of what the Houthis call the Quds-type land attack cruise missiles (LACM), known in Iran as the 351/Paveh. \\n\\nThe Houthi attacks in the southern Gulf of Aden--south of Socotra and toward Djibouti--hint at what expeditionary Houthi boat flotillas might accomplish one day, off the African littoral and even operating on the eastern coast of Africa in weak state environments like Sudan, al-Shabaab enclaves, and Somalia.  Imagine what a more effective capability could do, in the manner of the German merchant raiders that haunted the Indian Ocean in both world wars. (147) Addressing this threat more effectively will very likely be a priority issue for U.S. policymakers in the future, and one that the intelligence community will be called upon to support with analysis.\\n\\nThe Houthis could also view Russian military support as an opportunity. In a recent on-the-record address in Washington, D.C., the U.S. envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, was explicit about the risks of Russo-Houthi partnership, noting: \"Their relationship with Russia is extremely troubling... Russia is irritated by our strong policy on Ukraine, and they are seeking other outlets to retaliate, including in Yemen. They have been seeking to arm the Houthis, which would be a game-changer.\" (148) Lenderking was reflecting widespread press reporting of a potential Iran-brokered Russian supply of Yakhont/P-800 Onik anti-ship cruise missiles to the Houthis, which U.S. comments were probably intended to dissuade. \\n\\nPerhaps the only sharp threat facing the Houthis is the possibility that the Axis of Resistance writ large could suffer a crippling number of defeats in the current war--in Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere--and that Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah support to the Houthis might not be as available in the future as it has been in the past. For instance, Hassan Nasrallah\\'s death (150) removes one of the most ardent supporters in Lebanon of the Houthi cause, potentially disrupting a key relationship and potentially focusing Hezbollah on its own internal problems. Indeed, one wonders if the abundant manpower of the Houthis could provide a source of outsider regime security forces willing to crack down on local populations where Iran-backed groups are feeling pressure--such as Lebanon, Syria, and even Iraq or Iran. \\n\\nThis underlines the unusual potential finding that Iran itself may be more vulnerable than the Houthis. As U.S. Central Command\\'s General Erik Kurilla told Congress on March 7, 2024, the key to suppressing Iranian partner forces like the Houthis may come in the form of pressuring Iran itself to force the axis to back down (151)--a kind of inside-out approach in which Iran uses its soft power, its ideological leadership role within the axis, to convince a Houthi ceasefire (probably temporary) in the shipping lanes. If this turns out to be true, this would suggest that it may be easier to try to threaten \"the head of the octopus\" (152) (Iran) than to try to directly coerce its newest and most resilient and aggressive tentacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010), p. 189.\\n\\n(2) For a recent explainer on the axis, see Kian Sharifi, \"Iran\\'s \\'Axis Of Resistance\\': Different Groups, Same Goals,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, February 19, 2024.\\n\\n(3) Author\\'s geolocated incident dataset of the post-October 7 war.

So how foolish are we to engage in war with the arms when we could engage with the head?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Salmoni, Loidolt, and Wells note that the Houthis are known by a variety of names: \"the \\'Houthis\\' (al-Houthiyin), the \\'Houthi movement\\' (al-Haraka al-Houthiya), Houthist elements\\' (al-\\'anasir al-Houthiya), \\'Houthi supporters\\' (Ansar al-Houthi), or \\'Believing Youth Elements\\' (\\'Anasir al-Shabab al-Mu\\'min).\"\\n\\n(b) On January 19, 2021, the outgoing Trump administration designated the Houthi organizational institution Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), a step that the Biden administration almost immediately revoked on February 16, 2021. Since then, some Houthi leaders remained covered by older sanctions (and additional Houthi military leaders continue to be added to U.S. sanctions lists) for posing a \"threat to the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" Then on January 17, 2024, the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity but not as an FTO, a difference that enables easier access for humanitarian organizations and peace negotiators when the designation went into effect on February 17, 2024. For the newest SDGT designation, see \"Terrorist Designation of the Houthis: Press Statement by Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State,\" U.S. Department of State, January 17, 2024. For the prior sanctions, see \"Revocation of the Terrorist Designations of Ansarallah,\" U.S. Department of State, February 12, 2021. The U.S. government noted: \"Ansarallah leaders Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim remain sanctioned under E.O. 13611 related to acts that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" \\n\\n(c) One might look at the Israel July 20 attack on Houthi port facilities or the January 17, 2024, designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity as setbacks, but neither effort changed the Houthi behavior and the Houthis appear to have lost no senior leaders and no terrain since the war began, nor have they been notably economically damaged and the Houthi currency remains more stable than that of the internationally recognized government of Yemen. See \"The Economy,\" Yemen Review, April-June 2024.\\n\\n(d) There were two short pauses in Houthi anti-shipping attacks in 2024--April 9-24 and August 15-20--that are unexplained, though it is notable that these pauses coincided closely with periods of intense rain and flooding in Yemen, which tends to disrupt all military and non-military activities.\\n\\n(e) It is hard not to think of the movie boxer \"Rocky\" when looking at the fighting characteristics of the Houthis. Though this is charitable in the extreme--and does not reflect a sympathy for the Houthis--it is useful to view the Houthis in the Gaza war as an underdog boxer taking on much stronger opponents, whose aim may simply be to \"go the distance\" by supporting Hamas and the axis of resistance until the war ends (until the bell rings). Endurance and dogged pain aversion can be said to be characteristics of both the Houthis and the apocryphal Rocky Balboa.\\n\\n(f) This was the hope contained in this author\\'s assessment in his April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, which envisaged a triadic mechanism--increased usage and destruction of Houthi systems, compounded by tightened interdiction--slimming down Houthi arsenals.\\n\\n(g) The first phase, announced on November 14, 2023, called for attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea and on Israel proper. See Mohammed al-Harissi, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis vow to attack Israeli ships in Red Sea,\" National, November 14, 2023. The second phase, announced on December 9, 2023, declared Houthi intent to attack all ships headed to Israeli ports via the Red Sea. The third phase, announced after U.S./U.K. strikes on the Houthis on January 12, 2024, called for strikes on all U.S.- and U.K.-linked ships as well. Abdul Malik\\'s fourth phase was announced on May 3, 2024, broadened targeting to all ships whose owners or operators have visited Israeli ports. A fifth phase announced by Abdul Malik on July 21 was unclear in its expanded aims but seemed to focus more effort on Israel proper and its Mediterranean traffic and ports.\\n\\n(h) Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics suggest volume of shipping in the Red Sea dropped by 46 percent between November 2023 and February 2024, and has remained at these low levels since. Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics similarly suggest Bab el-Mandab transits dropped by 57 percent in the same comparison and stayed at this lower level since February 2024. Maritime Spotlight data; Lloyd\\'s List Intelligence presentation, August 9, 2024, provided to the author.\\n\\n(i) This study lists a number of cases in which Houthi attack claims do not appear to have been correct, notably attacks on the Mediterranean shipping and Indian Ocean vessels.  All the maritime attack case studies in this article draw upon the very useful Washington Institute Maritime Spotlight online tracker by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi.\\n\\n(j) In the author\\'s long study of the Houthi movement since the 2000s, a recurring feature is their keen eye for propaganda operations, about which the following listed authors dedicated entire chapters in their 2010 study. See Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010).\\n\\n(k) Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) also reports the interception of incoming attacks that are not counted by JMIC incident reporting. JMIC incidents are reported by shippers, who are not themselves witness to interceptions far away from their vessels. To give an example of the OPG intercept data, on September 24, 2024, a tweet released by @CENTCOM noted that \"U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed one Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicle over the Red Sea.\" See U.S. Central Command, \"Sept 24 U.S. Central Command Update: In the past 24 hours, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed...,\" X, September 24, 2024.\\n\\n(l) If JMIC and thus Maritime Spotlight are reliant on self-reporting of attacks by shippers, it stands to reason that some attacks will be simply not detected (neither intercepted nor landing close enough to a vessel to be noticed) or simply not revealed for some reason (perhaps insurance-related).\\n\\n(m) The United Kingdom takes part in Poseidon Archer planned joint strikes with the United States in Yemen, but it does not appear to mount preemptive \\'dynamic\\' (opportunistic) strikes on launchers ashore, which are all undertaken by the United States.\\n\\n(n) It is hard to tell sometimes whether a reported strike on a \"missile launcher\" is a preemptive U.S. action (as a missile is readied for launch, arguably counting as an \\'attack\\') or a strike on a storage site that cannot be considered an attack by Houthi forces. In the data collation in this piece, all such marginal or inconclusive cases are not counted as an attack.\\n\\n(o) Interestingly, the chart does appear to show a rise in Houthi attacks after the end of the extended presence of the USS Eisenhower and supporting escort vessels in the Red Sea from November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024. The Eisenhower returned to the Red Sea for a very intense period of Houthi attacks between May 6, 2024, and June 22, 2024, and there was no apparent downturn in attacks in that period. Since June 22, as later sections will detail (see \"Tactical Evolution\"), the Houthis seem to have exploited the reduction of U.S. presence. \\n\\n(p) On November 25, 2023, the Houthis claimed to strike an Israeli-linked container ship, CMA CGM Symi, in the Indian Ocean using a one-way attack drone, over 2,200 kilometers from the nearest Houthi-controlled area in Yemen. Considering the range, targeting support from Iran (in the form of the Safiz surveillance ship off the coast of India) is considered likely in this case. Details gathered from interviews with U.S. and U.K. military personnel for this study. \\n\\n(q) These include claimed attacks (all in 2024) on the Veracruz (April 24), MSC Vittoria 1 (May 7), MSC Alexandra (May 23), Aloraiq (June 1), and Anvil Point (July 1). \\n\\n(r) This includes all Houthi-claimed attacks launched either from Yemen or Iraq, which are likely to be comprehensive as the Houthis have a strong incentive to seek credit for such attacks. These Houthi-claimed attacks do not always result in confirmation of the attacks by Israel, particularly not when they are launched from Iraq. \\n\\n(s) The attack claims by IRI (including joint claims with the Houthis) often include videos of launches. The videos are not duplicated, being original each time, which is one indicator that attacks are genuinely being launched, but the lack of any supporting data means that it is still unclear whether all claimed attacks occur.\\n\\n(t) Very few Israeli press or government communiques give any insight into whether such IRI or IRI/Houthi-claimed projectiles reach Israel.\\n\\n(u) These are the claimed attacks on the Shorthorn Express (June 23), MSC Manazillo (June 26), Waler (June 28), the Ionnis (June 28), Lucky Sailor (July 1), and the Olvia (July 15). \\n\\n(v) These are the claimed attacks on the Destiny (May 15), the Essex (May 23), and the Minerva Antonia (May 29).

If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Opinion: Houthis’ rising threat', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Telengana Today']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-21T18:32:53+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'bdb10418-0874-596d-b2bc-a868cfa767f9', 'text': \"Two US Navy destroyers were attacked by the Houthis on Monday.

This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'published_date': '2024-11-21T18:32:53+00:00', 'publisher': 'Telengana Today', 'external_url': '', 'matching_spans': [{'sentence_start_index': 3956, 'sentence_end_index': 4330}, {'sentence_start_index': 893, 'sentence_end_index': 1224}, {'sentence_start_index': 6, 'sentence_end_index': 357}]}, {'index': 7, 'doc_id': '6415d077-0b8c-510b-bcba-6a8a63cd0a1b', 'title': 'U.S. Forces Strike More Houthi Targets in Yemen', 'text': 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces have conducted precision airstrikes on Houthi weapons storage facilities in Yemen amid the group’s ongoing threats to international shipping in the Red Sea region.\\n\\nThe operation, carried out on November 9-10, targeted multiple facilities housing advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to threaten U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024.

The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'published_date': '2024-11-21T18:32:53+00:00', 'publisher': 'Telengana Today', 'external_url': '', 'matching_spans': [{'sentence_start_index': 3956, 'sentence_end_index': 4330}, {'sentence_start_index': 893, 'sentence_end_index': 1224}, {'sentence_start_index': 6, 'sentence_end_index': 357}]}, {'index': 7, 'doc_id': '6415d077-0b8c-510b-bcba-6a8a63cd0a1b', 'title': 'U.S. Forces Strike More Houthi Targets in Yemen', 'text': 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces have conducted precision airstrikes on Houthi weapons storage facilities in Yemen amid the group’s ongoing threats to international shipping in the Red Sea region.\\n\\nThe operation, carried out on November 9-10, targeted multiple facilities housing advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to threaten U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot.

Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait!

These are all considered safe by the UK government.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt on October 26 following Israel’s attacks on Iran. It warns ongoing hostilities in the Middle East could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai, which includes the crossing at Rafah, and within 20km of the Egyptian/Libyan border (excluding El Salloum, where it advises against all but essential travel).\\n\\nIt also advises against all but essential travel to the following areas:\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing US and UK strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, the Foreign Office said: “Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that travel advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor travel advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.”\\n\\nThis advice is still current and has not changed since the Iranian missile attack on Israel.\\n\\nSeparately, the Foreign Office has warned that terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, and targets could include destinations popular with tourists. Most attacks in the past have been in the North Sinai region, but they may take place in other parts of the country too.\\n\\nThe risk is heightened during public holidays and festivals, such as Christmas and Ramadan, and is particularly high around religious sites, large public gatherings and places frequented by foreigners. Stay vigilant and carry your photo ID with you at all times.\\n\\nHas Egypt been affected by the conflict in the Middle East?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn September 29, the UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt, saying: “Ongoing hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region. Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.”\\n\\nSharing a border with both Israel and Gaza has meant that Egypt is closer to the conflict than any other nation. On October 27, 2023, an official confirmed that a drone fell near a medical facility in the Red Sea resort of Taba, near the Israeli border, injuring six people.\\n\\nSeparately, two Israeli tourists and their local guide died after a police officer opened fire on a group of Israeli tourists in Alexandria on October 8, 2023, according to reports by the Israeli foreign ministry. This has not been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.\\n\\nMore generally, the Foreign Office warns that the border between Israel and Egypt at Taba could close at short notice. Visitors should check with local authorities before trying to cross. It also warns that since the Israel-Hamas war started, demonstrations (often at short notice) have taken place. Tourists should be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is currently closed. The Foreign Office says that when this border is reopened, Israel, Egypt and the authorities in Gaza may determine procedures for who is permitted to cross and when.

Female travellers should also take care — as in other parts of the country, harassment and sexual assault can and do happen.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nSharm el-Sheikh reopened to British tourists in October 2019, four years after a bomb exploded on a Russian plane carrying 224 tourists and crew. Security measures were increased at the Red Sea resort: x-ray scanners in hotels, security walls and high perimeter fences around the airport were installed.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office no longer advises against travel to the area of Sharm el-Sheikh. This advice has not changed since the US and UK launched joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen at the beginning of 2024.\\n\\nFor context, the attacks in the Red Sea have been limited to the south, while the Egyptian Red Sea resorts are in the north, more than 1,000 miles away.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Hurghada?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Hurghada, a popular Red Sea resort. Again, travel advice has not been amended for the resort following the strikes on the Houthi bases in Yemen, nor after the intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you drink alcohol in Egypt?\\n\\nEgypt is an Islamic country. While attitudes are more relaxed in tourist resorts, customs can be very different elsewhere and more strict during Ramadan. Public drinking, for example, can lead to arrest — alcohol is only permitted in a licensed restaurant or bar.\\n\\nPossession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs can lead to long prison sentences or even the death penalty. Visitors should be aware that what is legal in the UK may not be legal in Egypt. In 2017, for example, a British woman was jailed for three years for taking painkillers into the country. Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is a prescription drug in the UK but is illegal in Egypt.\\n\\nWhat about taking photos in Egypt?\\n\\nBe aware of what you’re photographing. Taking pictures of military installations (strictly prohibited), embassies, government buildings, churches and even infrastructure such as train stations can lead to arrest. If you want to photograph any Egyptian citizens, you must have written permission from them; photographing children is not permitted.\\n\\nTaking or sharing photographs that are perceived to be damaging to the country’s image is also forbidden. Similarly, making strongly negative comments about Egypt or its politics, including on social media, can lead to you being detained.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are Egypt’s entry restrictions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor entry into Egypt, you’ll need at least six months of validity on your passport. You’ll also need to apply for a tourist visa to visit most of the country. These can be obtained online before you travel or on arrival at dedicated desks inside the airport. This is valid for up to three months.\\n\\nIf you’re travelling to the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you can get a free entry permission stamp upon arrival for stays of up to 15 days. You’ll have to get a visa if you want to stay longer or visit other places.\\n\\nDo I need vaccines for Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nThere are no essential vaccine requirements for visiting Egypt. However, the NHS suggests that it’s advisable to have polio and tetanus jabs. You may also want to consider hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies and typhoid.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of safety on the ground, it pays to be vigilant. Protests take place frequently and foreigners taking part in political activities in the country could be detained or subjected to other measures.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office says: “If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the immediate area as the atmosphere could change quickly and without warning. Police have previously used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition for crowd control.”\\n\\nAt popular tourist spots, visitors can be harassed for money or to buy things. There’s also a risk of theft and mugging, even in taxis. Travelling as part of an escorted tour can help reduce the risks. If you are a victim of crime, you should contact the local tourist police who can help you make a report.\\n\\nPublic displays of affection can also be frowned upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for female travellers?\\n\\nIn general, yes, it is safe for female travellers. However, there have been reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment in the country, including some affecting minors. Most of the reported incidents have taken place in the Red Sea region and, according to the Foreign Office, are often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office advises: “Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.”\\n\\n What can women do to stay safe while abroad?\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for LGBT travellers?\\n\\nIt can be problematic for LGBT travellers. While homosexuality is not technically illegal in Egypt, according to the Foreign Office, the charges of “debauchery” and “sexual deviance” have been used to prosecute LGBT people in the past. Dozens of people were arrested in 2017 on debauchery charges after waving a rainbow flag at a concert in Cairo, for example. Again, attitudes are more relaxed in tourist areas but public displays of affection are likely to cause issues.\\n\\n Is it safe to go diving in the Red Sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Egypt travel advice: is it safe to visit right now?', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Burlington Times-News']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-10-26T11:32:14+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'ce38fd6e-5797-58d2-a684-bcdd25b14c1f', 'text': ' The arbitrary arrests appear to be based on the detainees’ present or past employment.\\n\\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, carried out these arbitrary arrests while widespread hunger and thirst remain rampant across Yemen, including in areas they control, and during a recent, major cholera outbreak that the Houthis hid for several months, based on ongoing Human Rights Watch research.\\n\\n“The Houthis are using arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances as a political tool at a time when the people living in their territories lack even the most basic needs,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should immediately release all of these people, many of whom have spent their careers working to improve their country.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch spoke to 20 people with knowledge of the arrests, as well as 4 Yemen analysts. Their identities are not being revealed for their safety, as they fear reprisals. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents, videos, social media, and media reports, voice recordings, and other materials relevant to the detentions.\\n\\nHouthi forces did not present search or arrest warrants at the time of arrest, and the authorities have refused to tell families where those arrested are being held, meaning that these acts amount to enforced disappearances. They have held detainees incommunicado, without access to lawyers or their families. On June 19, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Houthi human rights office with questions regarding the arrests and concerns about the apparent absence of any due process. The Houthis have not responded.\\xa0\\n\\nAs far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, no charges have been brought against the people detained. However, Houthi authorities have a long history of bringing dubious charges against detained people, including espionage.\\n\\nStarting on June 10, Houthi authorities released a series of videos and curated social media posts on the Houthi-affiliated TV channel, Al-Masirah, and its related social media platforms. These show 10 Yemeni men who were detained between 2021 and 2023. Most of them have been held incommunicado.\\n\\nThe videos show the men confessing that they were spying for the United States and Israel, but there is a high risk that these confessions were coerced. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain confessions. Publishing videos of confessions undermines the right to fair trial and lacks credibility.\\n\\nThough the Houthis have not said whether the current arrests are linked to the videos and their related announcements of uncovering a “spy network,” sources, including analysts, said that they feared that the Houthis were trying to frame the recently detained people as spies.\\n\\nYemen analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch also suggested political motives for the arrests. The Yemeni government-controlled central bank issued a decision on May 30 to end transactions with six banks within Houthi territories that refused to move their headquarters to Aden, which is under the control of the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The decision has the potential for a significant negative economic impact on Houthi-controlled territories. Analysts said that the arrests may be an attempt to put pressure on the Yemeni government to reverse the decision.\\n\\nEnforced disappearances, in which the authorities detain a person and then refuse to acknowledge their whereabouts or situation when asked, are serious crimes under international law and are prohibited at all times under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\\n\\nAll of the detainees are Yemenis. The Houthis have told families not to speak out about the detention of their family members, in many cases saying that detainees will be released as soon as the Houthis have completed their interrogations, as long as they do not find anything.\\n\\n“[The Houthis] know there will not be an [international] escalation from the arrest of the Yemenis, but if they arrested international staff there will be a huge escalation from the international community,” said one source.\\n\\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, have called for the release of all UN and nongovernmental organization staff, as have other senior UN officials.\\n\\nHowever, some sources also told Human Rights Watch that the UN agencies or organizations where detainees had been working had not made efforts to contact detainees’ families, including those living abroad who could have been safely reached.\\xa0\\n\\n“Continuing to work like business as usual cannot be done,” a source said. “The abductees that were part of the confessions yesterday, there was no huge demand for their release, barely anything was said by UN agencies,” referring to those shown in videos.\\xa0\\n\\nOne political analyst said that “he wider weak international reaction … proves that from [the Houthis’] perspective, they did the right thing.”\\n\\nIt is imperative for the United Nations, independent groups working in Yemen, and concerned governments to take every action in their power to ensure the release of those detained, Human Rights watch said. Oman, which has been a mediator in negotiations between the Houthis and other warring parties, should work with other countries collectively to ensure that the Houthis release the detainees.\\n\\n“The international community should be doing everything in their power to ensure that these people are immediately released,” Jafarnia said. “Many of them have been invaluable members of Yemeni civil society organizations and staff in UN agencies and nongovernmental international groups.”\\n\\nBased on interviews with informed sources, Human Rights Watch found that, starting on the morning of Friday, May 31, Houthi forces began arresting employees of several nongovernmental organizations, raiding their homes and offices, though a few arrests were before that date. According to one source, more than 60 people had been arrested as of June 12.\\n\\nIn one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children – a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old – of a woman who works with a civil society organization, a source said.\\n\\nIn all but one case, Houthi forces did not tell relatives where they were taking the person arrested, and none have had contact with their family members since they were arrested, as far as Human Rights Watch could determine. With the exception of one case, the authorities did not tell relatives where their loved ones have been detained when asked. Such conditions amount to enforced disappearance.\\n\\nOn June 18, Volker Türk said that the six staff members from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) who had been detained “have not had contact with their families, nor has the UN been able to access them.” In separate statements, he added that two other staff, who have been “held incommunicado, without any due process,” and two staff from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), had “already been arbitrarily detained for a lengthy period.”\\n\\n“I can’t even describe the fear and concern that all of these people had for their safety and well-being,” one source said. “[The head of one organization] couldn’t eat for an entire week.”\\xa0\\n\\nWhile the conditions of those disappeared remains unknown, many sources said that the Houthis had not allowed family members to send needed medicines for the detainees, including for serious medical conditions. Human Rights Watch has documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention since 2015.\\n\\nSince the initial raids and arrests on May 31 and June 6, the Houthis have continued arresting people, prompting many people in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to flee their territory.\\xa0\\n\\nOne person who left Sanaa said, “Although I managed to flee.… I couldn’t sleep … I’ve had panic attacks every day since I fled from Sanaa … I’m very worr[ied] about my friends and colleagues in Sanaa who are just waiting for Houthis to arrest them.”\\xa0\\n\\n', 'title': 'HRW: Yemen Houthis Disappear Dozens of UN, Civil Society Staff', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Yemenonline']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-19T02:11:05+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'f5627f46-e2de-5286-997c-ff861870a9b1', 'text': \"Russia is recruiting hundreds of Yemeni men to fight in Ukraine through a shadowy trafficking operation, highlighting growing ties between Moscow and the Houthi rebel group, the Financial Times reports . \\n The Houthi movement, officially known as Ansar Allah, is an anti-US, anti-Semitic Shia Islamist political and military organization that holds de facto control over most of northern Yemen. The movemenent attacks in the Red Sea target commercial vessels, including oil tankers, to disrupt trade and assert influence, using explosive-laden boats, naval mines, and alleged Iranian-supplied missiles. The Houthis have committed severe human rights violations, including child soldier recruitment, detainee abuse, forced marriages, hostage-taking, aid diversion, and repression of women and LGBTQ+ individuals, according to the UN and human rights groups.  \\nThe operation underscores Russia’s efforts to avoid full mobilization as casualties rise, with the country also recruiting mercenaries from Nepal and India, while some 12,000 North Korean regular army troops have arrived in Kursk Oblast for combat against Ukrainian forces, FT says. \\n \\nAccording to FT, the Yemeni recruits are promised high-paying jobs and Russian citizenship, but upon arrival are forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to Ukraine’s front lines with the help of a Houthi-linked company.

It was the Houthis who committed most quickly to support Hamas after October 7, including their dramatic October 31, 2023, launch of the first-ever medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) against Israel by a member of the Axis of Resistance, Iran included. (3) Among the axis, only the Houthis--formally known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), and (since February 17, 2024) once again sanctioned by the United States for terrorism (b)--have struck and sunk commercial ships in support of Hamas. (4) After a year of notable setbacks for the axis--loss of terrain and leaders by Hamas, (5) the deaths of Iranian and Iraqi commanders, (6) an underwhelming Iranian strategic strike on Israel, (7) heavy leadership losses for Hezbollah (including overall leader Hassan Nasrallah), (8) and now Israeli ground incursions into Lebanon (9)--the Houthis have arguably weathered the year of war without suffering major setbacks. \\n\\nThis study aims to update the April 2024 study in CTC Sentinel, (10) which looked in detail at the Houthi war effort against Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and global shipping from October 2023 to a data cut-off of April 11, 2024. (11) This article also builds on two other foundational CTC Sentinel pieces: the September 2018 analysis (12) of the military evolution of the movement and the October 2022 study (co-authored with Adnan Jabrani and Casey Coombs) (13) that provided an in-depth profile of the Houthi p0litical-military leadership, its core motivations, and the considerable extent of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah influence within the movement. \\n\\nThe sections below will take forward (to the time of writing (October 1, 2024, for news events, and an attack data cut-off of August 31, 2024)) the analysis of the military development of the Houthi movement. The analysis will draw on open-source reporting of Houthi military activities, which includes vast amounts of marine traffic analysis, social media, and broadcast media imagery, and U.S. and U.K. government announcements regarding military operations. The piece will also draw heavily on the collation and analysis work undertaken by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\\'s Maritime Spotlight platform, (15) which maps and analyses Houthi attacks on shipping, and the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC), run by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). (16) Some data has been drawn from contacts in Western naval and intelligence services, and from contacts in Yemen with extensive on-the-ground access in Houthi-held areas.\\n\\nThe article starts by summarizing the trends visible in Houthi military activities in the second half of the post-October 7 period, from April to September 2024. With the broad outlines set, a detailed analysis follows. Houthi military performance will be dissected in terms of the operational tempo of Houthi attacks, the geographic reach demonstrated in Houthi strikes, and the evolution of Houthi tactics and preferred weapons systems. Special focus will be directed at the issue of why the Houthis strike the ships they do, with a view to better understanding the real level of intentionality (or otherwise) in Houthi targeting of specific vessels. The article will conclude with assessment of the impact of U.S.-led military operations to protect shipping and an update to the April 2024 CTC Sentinel assessment of the Houthi movement\\'s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe overall trend in the Houthi war effort since the last CTC Sentinel analysis in April, and more broadly across the entire postOctober 2024 period, has been the successful continuation and improvement of Houthi attacks on shipping and on Israel. Despite the commitment of significant U.S., European, and Indian naval forces, the Houthi anti-shipping campaign was not suspended at any point. (d) Escalating U.S. and U.K. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen also did not end the Houthi anti-shipping campaign or even significantly reduce its operational tempo. (18) If anything, in the author\\'s view, the Houthis have arguably improved their effectiveness and efficiency as the war has progressed, by learning lessons and taking advantage of fluctuating U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea. In the manner of an underdog boxer trying to \\'go the distance\\' to the final bell, (e) the Houthis have shown resilience and resisted a superpower\\'s effort to suppress their anti-shipping campaign. The Houthis also weathered a heavy Israeli retaliatory strike on one of their two main port complexes and continued to attack Israel. If, as the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article assessed, (19) the Houthi aim is to vault to the front ranks of the Axis of Resistance by demonstrating fearlessness and pain tolerance in support of Hamas and in opposition to Israel and the U.S.-U.K. coalition, (20) then the Houthis have succeeded. From the perspective of Ansar Allah\\'s leaders, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis may see themselves as the main winners in the post-October 2023 conflict.\\n\\nAs the following sections will dissect in detail, the Houthis can claim to have maintained a broadly consistent operational tempo against shipping, with an apparent surge of effort in June and July 2024--precisely at the point that the U.S.-led international effort might have hoped the Houthi arsenals would be emptying and their pace of attacks reducing. (f) In this author\\'s view, as the below sections will outline, the resilience of Houthi domestic drone and drone boat production has been demonstrated, as has the movement\\'s line of supply to Iran-provided experts and resupply of irreplaceable Iran-sourced materiel. (21) As this article evidences below, many of the Houthi\\'s claims--of extended-range attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean or the Mediterranean--appear unfounded and perhaps deliberately falsified, but the Houthis have nonetheless spread growing fear that they can attack shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthi capacity to precisely identify, find, track, and strike ships by their owner\\'s nationality or ties to Israel may have been greatly overstated, but there are signs that the Houthis are gradually improving their targeting effort. In the author\\'s view (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the tactical sophistication of Houthi attacks is also steadily increasing from a very low initial base, aided by their ability to operate small boat flotillas in close proximity to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping lanes.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) from the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (22) it is sobering to note that assessed Houthi weaknesses--such as the technical deficiencies of their anti-shipping attacks and air defenses--may be less apparent now. Other exploitable Houthi weaknesses, such as their extended maritime line of supply to Iran and related smuggling networks, have not yet been effectively addressed by their adversaries. Regarding potential threats facing the Houthis, Iran has not been effectively levered into making the Houthis cease their attacks; nor has more united Yemeni opposition been aided to present a more urgent land warfare threat to the Houthis that might divert effort and attention from anti-shipping operations. As a result, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis can look back at the last year of war with satisfaction: Their position has strengthened, enemy countermeasures have been weathered, and they have no imminent threats on the horizon. This strongly suggests that the Houthis will sustain their anti-shipping and antiIsrael attacks as long as a Gaza and/or Lebanon war continues, if not beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthi military campaign has gone through some distinct stages since October 2023, often (but not always) reflected in the \"phases\" announced by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi. (g) The key trend has been a Houthi effort to sustain or increase their attacks on shipping and on Israel proper, despite obstacles such as U.S./U.K. airstrikes on launchers or the declining number of shippers using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (h) The liberal Houthi claiming policy, which either accidentally or deliberately appears to claim attacks that have not happened, (i) hints at their desire to maximize the apparent tempo, reach, and impact of their attacks. With a strong historic focus on propaganda operations, causing the impression of attacks may be as useful to the Houthis as the number of real attacks itself. \\n\\nAssessing how many attacks the Houthis have sent into the shipping lanes is an imprecise art because one must factor in both proven and strongly suspected completed attacks (evidenced by hits or near-misses on ships) (23) but also strongly suspected un-completed attacks (evidenced by the interception of inbound attacks by naval vessels in the shipping lanes). (k) Most collators of attack metrics versus commercial ships (such as JMIC and Maritime Spotlight) count only completed attacks on commercial ships. By slotting together JMIC incident data and other shipping data (collated by Maritime Spotlight) with the intercept data, one can gain a fuller picture of how many attacks the Houthis actually launch.\\n\\nFigure 1 includes the Maritime Spotlight-reported strikes on shipping, (24) fused with an additional set of intercepted attacks gathered in the author\\'s own dataset of U.S., U.K., and European-claimed interceptions in the shipping lanes. (25) Even then, these composite figures are probably a slight underreporting of actual strikes, as some attacks will be missed completely by collators, (l) and some attacks are disrupted in the launch phase by U.S. strikes (m) in Yemen but may be confused with strikes on storage sites where the weapons are not being readied for use against shipping at that moment. \\n\\nWith these caveats noted, the below statistics tell a story of relative consistency in Houthi anti-shipping efforts, with an upward step-change of attacks in the summer of 2024. (26) What the chart clearly does not show is a steady decline in Houthi attack activity in the face of international countermeasures--even during periods of constant U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea (November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024, and May 6, 2024, to June 22, 2024). (o) The percentage of completed attacks is 38 percent, averaged across the entire coverage period, with minimal variation across the period, suggesting a large proportion of intercepts (especially of slower-moving Houthi drones). \\n\\nAs well as wanting to be seen to sustain the tempo of their attacks, the Houthis also took pains to portray their geographic reach as ever-expanding. A new phase of claimed long-range strikes started in March 2024, with Houthi communiques threatening to strike out across the Indian Ocean basin as far south as the Cape of Good Hope off South Africa. (28) At the start of the Gaza war, there were two anti-shipping attacks on Israel-linked vessels in the eastern Indian Ocean: drone attacks on the CMA CGM Symi (November 24, 2023) and the Chem Pluto (December 23, 2024), both of which occurred closer to India than to Yemen and which may have employed Iranian naval and intelligence assets rather than Houthi ones. (p) Closer to Yemen, the Houthis did undertake three attacks on vessels at the eastern and southern edges of the Gulf of Aden: one near Djibouti (MSC Orion, April 26, 2024), and two east of Socotra (MSC Sarah V of June 24, 2024, and Maersk Sentosa, July 9, 2024). (29) A rash of claimed attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean by the Houthis appear to be erroneous or deliberately falsified. (q) A concatenation of these events put a chill on Indian Ocean shipping and resulted in some shipping lines taking longer mid-ocean routes to avoid the Yemeni and Horn of African littoral. (30) As has often been the case, an inflated perception of Houthi capability and aggressiveness may have achieved the effect the Houthis were seeking.\\n\\n\\n\\nHouthi attacks against Israel itself were never numerous and have become rarer as the war has dragged on. Direct Houthi attacks on Israel were most numerous in November 2023, with five attacks in that month following the first-ever MRBM attack on Israel by an \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member on October 31, 2024. Thereafter, Houthi-claimed direct attacks on Israel averaged just three per month in December 2023 to August 2024. \\n\\n (32) The Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) (33) began to jointly claim attacks on Israel from June 6, 2024, onward. (34) The IRI is an online brand used since October 2023 to gather together and anonymize the claims of Iran-backed militants in Iraq as they attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, purportedly in connection to the Gaza war. (35) From June 6 to July 15, IRI and the Houthis (the latter using the moniker \"Yemeni Armed Forces\") jointly claimed six long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, plus four attacks on Israeli onshore port facilities in Eilat, Haifa, and Ashdod. (36) These attacks appear to be servicing Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s May 3 instruction to commence the fourth phase of the anti-shipping war in which any ships interacting with Israeli ports should be struck--not only those closest to the Houthis in Eilat but also those interacting with Israel\\'s Mediterranean ports. \\n\\nAs is the case with more than 169 drone and missile attacks on Israeli land targets solely claimed by the IRI (at the time of writing on September 24, 2024), (38) it is almost impossible to verify that these Houthi-IRI launches occurred, (s) and it appears likely (based on multi-source analysis) that very few of the attacks reached Israel. (t) As attacks on shipping are more likely to be reported (via systems like JMIC), it might be expected that more evidence would exist of the six Houthi-IRI-claimed long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, (u) yet these also cannot be confirmed. (39) An earlier set of three Houthi-claimed (i.e., without IRI) long-range strikes on Israel-linked ships in the eastern Mediterranean in the May 15-29, 2024, period also do not correspond with maritime security incident reporting, casting doubt on the fidelity of the claims. (v) However, the June 30, 2024, killing of a mid-level Houthi officer (by a U.S. airstrike) at a drone or missile launch site in Iraq does lend additional credence to the claims of Houthi-IRI joint operations. \\n\\nWhile Houthi attacks on Israel have been sporadic and ineffective, they have occasionally been spectacular. MRBM strikes were launched on Israel on June 3 (41) and July 21 (42) (both on Eilat), and September 17. The latter case was claimed by the Houthis as the first MRBM (out of seven efforts) to penetrate Israel\\'s Arrow and Iron Dome systems, (43) with either a whole missile or intercepted debris falling in an area 15 kilometers from Ben Gurion airport and 25 kilometers from Tel Aviv--wounding nine people in this civilian area, (44) which neither Iran nor Hezbollah has attacked since the Gaza war started. (45) Though the MRBM was claimed to be a new \"hypersonic\" design by the Houthis, (46) there has been no Israeli or Western admission of a hypersonic attack, and it was more likely an extended-range supersonic MRBM such as the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar. (w) Since then, one more MRBM was fired by the Houthis at Israel (on September 27, 2024), again being intercepted. \\n\\nA final notable Houthi strike on Israel was the July 19, 2024, drone attack on the center 0f Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli civilian and injured at least four--once again, an action that neither Iran nor Hezbollah has dared to take since the outset of the Gaza war. (48) The drone, named Jaffa by the Houthis (the Arabic name for the Tel Aviv area) was an extended-range Iranian-made Sammad-3 drone. (49) The drone penetrated Israel\\'s battle-tested, low-level defenses by arriving from the west, over the Mediterranean coast, after apparently having taken a very long route via the African continent. (50) U.S. and Israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that it traveled via Eritrea, Sudan, and Egypt, thus avoiding the picket line of U.S. and European air defense vessels in the Suez area, and bypassing Israel\\'s own main southfacing defenses. (51) While the tactical surprise generated by the intricate and well-planned flightpath will be difficult to replicate, the incident demonstrated the higher-end of Houthi technical capability, potentially utilizing Iranian or Hezbollah route planning assistance, in this author\\'s view. In finding a new--but fleeting--way to penetrate Israeli defenses, the July 19, 2024, drone attack on Tel Aviv is reminiscent of the March 19, 2024, cruise missile strike on Eilat, (52) another \\'first\\' where successful penetration was enabled by elaborate route planning, that time via central Iraq and Jordan airspace. \\n\\nIsrael\\'s powerful counterstrike to the Tel Aviv drone attack--Operation Outstretched Arm, the July 20, 2024, destruction of a significant portion of the Houthi oil storage infrastructure at Hodeida (54)--was probably painful to the Houthis, as was the September 29, 2024, follow-on strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa ports. (55) However, these blows also (in the author\\'s view) brought the Houthis attention and recognition as the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member hitting Israel the hardest and in the most novel and spectacular ways. (56) The July 21 Houthi MRBM strike at Israel was one immediate response to the July 20, 2024, Hodeida strike, (57) and another was Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s statement the same day that the fifth phase of Houthi military operations in the current war would involve moving \"to a new level of anti-Israel operations.\" (58) He added that the \"Yemeni people are pleased to be in direct confrontation with the Israeli enemy.\" (59) A new September 27, 2024, MRBM strike on Israel drew a further September 29, 2024, Israeli strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa. \\n\\n\\n\\nSince November 2023, risk analysts, shipping companies, and insurers have all put a great deal of effort into understanding why the Houthis do or do not target vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (61) The Houthi clearly employ a kind of elective and selective targeting because only a tiny proportion of ships using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have been targeted. For example, there was still an average of 852 ships a month transiting the Bab el-Mandab in February to August 2024, (62) the level at which the Red Sea reset after an initial drop from pre-war levels of over 2,100 ship transits each month. (63) Of these 850-odd transits, (64) the Houthis have, in the most intense month of attacks in June 2024, completed or attempted attacks on only 4.9 percent of ships. (65) That means 95.1 percent of ships transited the Red Sea without being attacked in that month, (66) underlining the manner in which the Houthis have a very large universe of potential targets to choose from, even when the Red Sea is less busy.\\n\\nHow do the Houthis choose their targets out of this mass of ships?  \\n\\nAll of these categorizations require a degree of knowledge about the ownership, management, and vessel movement and port visits of commercial shipping. This data can be gained from open-source websites, but care and experience are required to differentiate between current and outdated information. As noted by Maritime Spotlight founding editor Noam Raydan, the Houthis appear to have started the war with knowledge about shipping lines and vessels that Iran had previously linked to Israeli owners and Israeli management--and which Iran had often targeted in the Persian Gulf in the 2019-2023 period. (71) To this short list, the Houthis also added new research on shipping assets linked to Israel and then (after January 12, 2024) also ships linked to the United States and the United Kingdom. (72) In the fourth phase of anti-shipping attacks undertaken since May 3, 2024, the Houthis will have needed to try to identify vessels not directly involved in Israeli trade but owned or managed by companies and individuals with apparent business in Israel or even personal connections to Israel. (73) The number of vessels tangentially linked to Israel, the United States, or the United Kingdom provides a very wide set of target options.\\n\\nThe broadening net of targets authorized by Abdul Malik al-Houthi has also included many Russian-linked and Chinese-linked vessels. (x) These great powers should, in theory, be well-positioned to negotiate safe passage due to their geopolitical alignment with the anti-Western \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' (y) yet they have both seen their cargos and vessels attacked repeatedly. (z) One reason may be the sheer availability of such targets: As the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted, nearly 74 percent of the southbound Red Sea oil traffic in the first half of 2023, (74) just before the war started, was made up of Russian oil cargos carried by the so-called \"dark fleet,\" often headed to East Asia. (75) As LNG tankers and major global shipping lines abandoned the lower Red Sea early in the conflict, (76) an even higher proportion of the remaining Red Sea transits was presumably (in the author\\'s view) made up by these smaller, costconscious, and risk-acceptant shippers willing to risk the journey. These same shippers have often, in the past, brought Russian oil to Israel, and are therefore perfectly valid targets from a Houthi perspective. \\n\\nJMIC statistics suggest that 14 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, were targeted because outdated ownership data triggered the extant Houthi targeting criteria. (78) In some cases vessels carrying Russian oil, notably Andromeda Star, have also been misidentified with consulted outdated materials as British-owned and attacked.  \\n\\nCan the Houthis Maintain a Target Lock?\\n\\nIf one problem is incorrect characterization of whether a ship meets the targeting criteria, a parallel problem is whether the Houthis have a sufficiently good ability to differentiate and track targets during an attack. If they do not, then it is very possible (in the author\\'s view) that they may undertake attacks on a certain ship but end up striking a different one. Quite a lot of evidence supports this theory. First, JMIC statistics suggest that as high as 37 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, did not meet the Houthis\\' own extant targeting criteria. (79) Second, the Houthis have struck Iranian ships (ac) and vessels that had recently left Houthi ports, (ad) or which were visiting Houthi ports, (ae) all categories of vessel that would presumably have a lower risk of being intentionally targeted.\\n\\nThird, the Houthis have frequently appeared confused about which ships they struck: (af) for instance, claiming hits on multiple ships on July 11, 2024, with no apparent knowledge of the presence of the only actual ship struck (the Russian oil-bearing Rostrom Stoic), or the unwitting Houthi targeting of a Saudi tanker, Amjad, on September 2, 2024, which the Houthis mistook for the Russian oil-bearing Blue Lagoon 1. (80) Fourth, the Houthis have sometimes claimed to hit ships that are not physically present in the targeted waterway: For instance, the May 7, 2024, claim to have targeted the MSC Michela in the Red Sea when the ship (and indeed all MSC vessels) are no longer using the Red Sea, and the Michela was instead in the Atlantic Ocean. \\n\\nTo understand how the Houthis \"find, fix and finish\" (ag) a ship, once they think they have identified a legitimate target, it is important to look at the sensors available to them. Wide-area surveillance giving a \\'common operational picture\\' of what vessels are visiting the Red Sea is mostly provided by ship-based transponders, the Automatic Identification System (AIS). (82) This system--available in simple form via non-subscription websites and in fuller form via subscription services--accurately maps all vessels in a maritime space with a velocity vector (indicating speed and heading), ship name, classification, call sign, registration numbers, and other information. (83) To reduce the risk of AIS being used to predict the location of a vessel (say, in the three to five minutes flight time of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) at 300 kilometers distance), (84) the UK Maritime Trade Organization advised from June 13 onward that vessels weigh the navigational and collision risks of turning their AIS off in high-threats areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and consider turning their AIS off when under attack and altering course in order to prevent their targeting by dead reckoning (i.e., projecting their future location due to their bearing and speed). \\n\\nAIS is likely not the only source of targeting information used by the Houthis, not least as the JMIC data shows that 13 percent of attacks have successfully struck a ship even when AIS was turned off. There are indications that long-range electronic intelligence (ELINT) is used by the Houthis to track ships, even those with their AIS transponders switched off. For example, JMIC guidance stresses the need to reduce \"non-essential emissions: other than AIS such as \\'intraship UHF/VHF transmissions.\\'\" (86) U.S. and U.K. naval officers privately confirm that the Houthis do listen in to bridge-to-bridge communications. (87) The United States and the United Kingdom seem to have tried to reduce Houthi ELINT capabilities: As noted in the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (88) the United States undertook multiple sequences of airstrikes in 2023 and 2024 on retransmission towers and GSM cell towers on high ground overlooking the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (89) Cellphone emissions close to shore may also be vulnerable to direction-finding, (90) not least because the Houthis control the key Yemeni telecommunications service providers, who are based in Sanaa. (91) It is also possible the Houthis have found ways to subscribe to commercial services that can triangulate terrestrial radio and combine it with AIS tracking. The Houthis are known to have received so-called Virtual Radar Receivers from Iran (92) that can create a targeting solution for aerial targets by fusing together open-source transponder and radio detection services. (93, ah) In the author\\'s view, the Houthis have probably already (with Iranian help) developed similar systems to combine vessel monitoring and radio direction-finding data.\\n\\nIn a final addition to this sensor network, the Houthis also probably utilize close-in sensors, such as surveillance UAVs, ship-borne AIS and radio monitoring, and visual scanning from boats. (94) At the outset of the conflict, the Houthis appear to have received radar and electronic intelligence steers from Iranian vessels (95) (such as Iranian frigates purportedly undertaking counter-piracy patrols, (ai) or various Iranian spy ships before they left the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by mid-April 2024).  \\n\\nBy achieving closer shadowing of target vessels (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the Houthis appear to be reducing the timein-flight limitation of their long-range strike systems (which can exceed 100 minutes for a drone flying 300 kilometers, during which time a ship can move by as much as 75 kilometers). (98) Houthi missiles and drones may carry terminal guidance systems--certainly semi-active radar homing for anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), (99) also electro-optical cameras in UAVs, (100) and possibly (though this is unconfirmed) some form of guidance system in some ASBMs as well. (101) The combination of wide-area surveillance, close-in target shadowing, and terminal guidance has allowed the Houthis to achieve some impressive feats of marksmanship, such as an apparent near-miss on a U.S. aircraft carrier (ak) and a number of hits or very close misses by ASBMs on ships approximately 150-200 kilometers from launch points. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe prior April 2024 CTC Sentinel study on the Houthi war effort in October 2023 to April 2024 provided an in-depth review of Houthi anti-shipping weapons--the Mohit and Asef ASBMs, the Al-Mandab-2 anti-ship cruise missile, a variety of fixed and delta-wing explosive-carrying UAVs, plus explosive drone boats (unmanned surface vehicles, or USVs). (102) This study will not repeat the lengthy profiles of these weapons and how they have been employed by the Houthis, only insofar as their mode of employment has changed significantly since then. The April 2024 study anticipated a gradual depletion of higher-end systems like ASBMs, but this did not manifest. (103) The following chart (Figure 2) shows numbers of projectiles detected by the author as having been employed by the Houthis in anti-shipping attacks since the end of April 2024. (104) Like all attack data, this is an imprecise art and is only meant to be indicative of the number of missiles, (am) UAVs, and USVs reported by coalition forces as intercepted during attacks, or reported by shippers impacting near or on vessels in proven attacks. Trends include the rise in attacks by explosive drone boats (USVs) in the summer; a more even spread of attack types; and a consistent drumbeat of UAV attacks, probably reflecting the relative ease of producing such systems inside Yemen. \\n\\nIn qualitative terms, the main change in Houthi anti-shipping attacks was the continual refinement of tactics regarding the combination of weapons systems. Three stages of development can be observed; in each case, the tactics were first applied in the Red Sea and then were extended to the Gulf of Aden. (106) The stages overlap and are not exclusive--in many cases, the Houthis mixed and matched older and newer tactics--but they do seem to have unfolded as a progression to more complex operations. \\n\\n After a brief period of failing to replicate the seizure of the Galaxy Leader, the Houthis commenced stand-off attacks in December 2023 to late May 2024, largely using either UAVs or ASBMs or cruise missiles but not a mix. (108) Accurate ASBM shots became regular in the Red Sea toward the end of June 2024 and continued through mid-July.  \\n\\n The Houthis appear to have begun mixing UAVs and ASBMs or other missiles in series of attacks on single vessels in the Red Sea from the end of May and into early June.  \\n\\nAll-systems, close-up, and stand-off. The third stage of development also overlapped the first two, manifesting first in the Red Sea, and was characterized by much greater involvement of Houthi small boat flotillas, typically including at least one USV. (109) These \\'hunter-killer\\' packs first targeted the bulk carrier Tutor in the Red Sea on June 12, causing the vessel to sink on June 18, only the second ship to be sunk (at the time of publication) by the Houthis. (110) The Tutor attack was notable for a successful \"tail-chase\" by at least one explosive drone boat that crippled the vessel, (111 as) followed by subsequent attacks on the stranded and abandoned vessel that may have included UAVs, ASBMs, and possibly demolition charges placed by Houthis on small boats.   (112) While evacuating the crew, a coalition naval vessel destroyed another nearby USV. Days later, while adrift and unguarded, the Sounion was boarded by Houthi commandos who set barrels of explosive on the deck and detonated them in a vivid videoed propaganda attack that demonstrated almost complete Houthi freedom of action. \\n\\nAs the author\\'s April 2024 CTC Sentinel article noted, the Houthis were extensively drilling their fast attack boat and USV flotilla between early August 2023 and the outset of the Gaza war in October, (114) probably related to rising U.S.-Iran naval tensions in the Arabian Gulf, where Iran had made six attacks on Israeli or U.S.-linked vessels between February and July 2023.  (115) Houthi naval commander Brigadier General Mansour al-Saadi had boasted in mid-December that around 80 such USVs had been stockpiled, (116) and this author\\'s April 2024 report noted that very few of these had been used at that time, but many have been subsequently employed in June-August 2024. (117) The Houthi flotilla utilizes fishing boats, islands, and even foreign coastlines (in Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia) as sustainment hubs, (118) exploiting restrictive coalition rules of engagement to merge within civilian traffic. (119) The Houthi flotilla has employed tactical drones, electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, and AIS trackers to shadow and report on target ships, (120) with periodic reports of them approaching or hailing vessels to confirm their identity. (121) Houthi flotilla are very rarely attacked and do not appear to suffer communication problems with the mainland. (122) This would seem (in the author\\'s view) to be from the Houthi perspective an ideal combination of forward observation and close-in attack options, backed-up by long-range strike capabilities that can now be assured of updated information on ship locations.\\n\\n\\n\\n For U.S., U.K., and E.U. naval forces, these operations arguably (in the view of the author) represent the most intense maritime trial-by-fire since conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Falklands.   (126)) The Houthis (and the broader Axis of Resistance) might achieve a significant propaganda boon if a U.S. vessel were badly damaged or sunk, and even the withdrawal of a U.S. carrier battle group from the Red Sea was loudly trumpeted by the Houthis as a victory. In the sphere of air defense, the Houthis have not come close to threatening U.S.-manned aircraft, but they have taken a heavy toll on the U.S. drone fleet, destroying at least nine MQ-9 Reapers between November 8, 2023, and October 1, 2024. \\n\\nThe United States and partner forces in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have clearly reduced the damage that the Houthis could do to global shipping, as evidenced by an assessed 62 percent interception rate shown in Figure 1 of this study. In addition to interception of launched attacks, the U.S.-U.K. air campaign over Yemen has undoubtedly limited Houthi capabilities to find and fix commercial ships--for instance, a determined effort to blind the Houthi targeting system with intensified strikes on Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) in June 2024. \\n\\nHowever, the reduction of U.S. naval presence in the Red Sea, particularly the withdrawal of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in late June, has arguably opened up the space needed for the Houthis to redeploy their small boat flotillas and recommence more effective wolf pack tactics. (127) Of note, naval assets do not appear to have been sufficient to guard the Tutor and the Sounion after they lost power and were abandoned, (128) allowing the Houthis to access these stricken ships. Houthi attack patterns in June and July appeared to show greater freedom of movement for their small boat and USV flotillas and an enhanced ability to follow and repeatedly attack ships. (129) In sum, in the view of the author, freedom of safe navigation has clearly not been restored by the efforts of international navies, respectable shippers have not been assured, and Houthi attacks are not deterred.\\n\\nEqually concerning, one of the greatest exploitable weaknesses of the Houthis--significant reliance on a maritime line of supply to Iran, for military resupply and for financing--has not been addressed by the international naval presence in the Red Sea. Whatever military supplies cannot be made entirely locally in Yemen--notably missile guidance, engines, fuel, warheads, and C4ISR systems (130)--has to be squeezed through the Houthi Red Sea ports or smuggled overland through enemy territory controlled by Yemen\\'s internationally recognized government. Yet, the policing of the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the Houthis seems to have slackened during the current conflict, not tightened, in the author\\'s view. At least six large ships have visited the Houthi-held port of Hodeida in 2024 without stopping for inspection, as required by a U.N. Security Council resolution, at the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) hub at Djibouti. (131) This is unusual behavior that only started in the spring of 2024 when the war was underway.  (132) Alongside the risk of large ship transfers, which are legally difficult to interdict as they require flag-state permission to board, (133) there have also been a trickle of large dhows and fishing boats entering the Houthi-held inlets south and north of Hodeida (which were detailed in the April 2024 article), (134) with around 12 ships subsequently docking there in May-August 2024, according to the author\\'s local contacts. (135) On June 26-27, 2024, the Houthis also managed to overcome the aerial embargo by diverting a Yemenia flight to Amman so that it instead landed in Beirut, Lebanon, and returned from there to Sanaa, Yemen. (136) What all this points to is the likelihood that the Houthis have been able to sustain their operational tempo--despite increased expenditure of munitions and U.S.-U.K. strikes--because they are being resupplied at an adequate rate.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT Analysis of the Houthi War Effort The April 2024 CTC Sentinel study issued an assessment of the demonstrated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the Houthis in the first period of their war against Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, and global shipping. As the war turns one year old, the picture is arguably even bleaker for the forces trying to contain the Houthi threat.\\n\\nThe strengths shown by the Houthis are abundant and have been reinforced by events: Their pain tolerance was illustrated by their apparent insensitivity to having at least a third of their oil storage facilities destroyed by Israel on July 20, which they answered immediately by firing a ballistic missile at Israel and vowing to double their efforts to strike the Israeli state. The strategic depth of Yemen--its size and mountainous terrain--had complicated the task of finding and destroying Houthi missile and drone systems.  \\n\\nSome weaknesses identified in April 2024 appear to have been partially addressed by the Houthis. One senior U.S. naval officer with responsibility for the Yemen theater told the author in mid-2024, \"We came to see that the Houthis are not a ragtag force: they are resourced, trained, funded, stocked, supplied, and resupplied.\" (139) As noted, the Houthi line of supply to Iran has probably strengthened, with no apparent cost for bypassing a U.N. inspection regime. (140) As outlined above, Houthi air defenses are gradually strengthening, albeit only against drones, and the technical weakness of long-range target acquisition and tracking are arguably being mitigated with new wolf pack flotilla tactics. As one U.K. naval officer with experience of the Red Sea operations told the author: \"Iran has excellent marine traffic intelligence; the Houthis don\\'t.\" (141) Yet, there is some evidence to suggest that the Houthis have learned how to offset this weakness and track intended targets. (142) As this author noted previously, the Houthis could not operate in proximity to strong Western naval forces in the Red Sea, but the thinning out of these forces offsets the Houthi weakness in tactical proficiency. The economic weakness of the Houthi regime was briefly exploited by the Yemeni government before being abruptly turned off by Yemen\\'s backers--Saudi Arabia, the United Nations, and the United States.\\n\\nMajor opportunities now beckon for the Houthis and the \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' with the Houthis arguably having delivered the best military performance of all the axis players in the current war, in the author\\'s view. There is strong potential for the Houthis to build on their successes in severely constricting one of the world\\'s busiest global chokepoints, the Bab el-Mandab. International shippers, insurers, and governments must be careful to ensure the Houthis do not learn how to effectively monetize their ability to shut the Bab el-Mandab and Suez Canal to selected nations or shipping companies, which can be levered into a lucrative extortion racket. (143) As Houthi targeting capability gets more selective, this terrorist threat finance risk may rise, unless it is actively monitored and deterred through sanctions enforcement.  \\n\\nThe Houthis\\' elevation to a top-tier member of the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' presents other opportunities to the whole Iran-led bloc. Under the Houthis, Yemen has become a place from which the Iran threat network can undertake attacks on Israel that Iran itself does not dare to mount--already including ballistic missile and drone attacks on Tel Aviv. (144) Yemen might also be used by the axis as a way to mount attacks on other targets--such as U.S. forces--in a way that may not draw retaliation on more pain-sensitive parts of the axis--for instance, Iran. At present, the Houthis have used the boogey-man reputation of hypersonic weapons as an attentiongrabber, but in the future, Yemen could be an ideal site for such weapons considering its geographic placement and its proven ability to conceal launch sites in its rugged interior.\\n\\nLikewise, the expansion of Houthi presence into areas like Iraq--where a senior Houthi missileer was killed by a U.S. strike on June 30, 2024--could put Houthi strike capabilities in new areas such as Saudi Arabia\\'s northern border, (bi) the Iraq-Jordanian border, (bj) and Syria. (145) Where Iran and its local partners can sometimes be fearful of the consequences of striking foes such as Israel or the United States, the Houthis may be more willing. This is particularly the case as key Iranian partners like Hamas and increasingly Hezbollah face severe military pressure from Israel. It is intriguing that a more visible Houthi presence in Iraq (146) seemed to coincide with the first use by Iraqi groups (under the IRI umbrella) of what the Houthis call the Quds-type land attack cruise missiles (LACM), known in Iran as the 351/Paveh. \\n\\nThe Houthi attacks in the southern Gulf of Aden--south of Socotra and toward Djibouti--hint at what expeditionary Houthi boat flotillas might accomplish one day, off the African littoral and even operating on the eastern coast of Africa in weak state environments like Sudan, al-Shabaab enclaves, and Somalia.  Imagine what a more effective capability could do, in the manner of the German merchant raiders that haunted the Indian Ocean in both world wars. (147) Addressing this threat more effectively will very likely be a priority issue for U.S. policymakers in the future, and one that the intelligence community will be called upon to support with analysis.\\n\\nThe Houthis could also view Russian military support as an opportunity. In a recent on-the-record address in Washington, D.C., the U.S. envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, was explicit about the risks of Russo-Houthi partnership, noting: \"Their relationship with Russia is extremely troubling... Russia is irritated by our strong policy on Ukraine, and they are seeking other outlets to retaliate, including in Yemen. They have been seeking to arm the Houthis, which would be a game-changer.\" (148) Lenderking was reflecting widespread press reporting of a potential Iran-brokered Russian supply of Yakhont/P-800 Onik anti-ship cruise missiles to the Houthis, which U.S. comments were probably intended to dissuade. \\n\\nPerhaps the only sharp threat facing the Houthis is the possibility that the Axis of Resistance writ large could suffer a crippling number of defeats in the current war--in Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere--and that Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah support to the Houthis might not be as available in the future as it has been in the past. For instance, Hassan Nasrallah\\'s death (150) removes one of the most ardent supporters in Lebanon of the Houthi cause, potentially disrupting a key relationship and potentially focusing Hezbollah on its own internal problems. Indeed, one wonders if the abundant manpower of the Houthis could provide a source of outsider regime security forces willing to crack down on local populations where Iran-backed groups are feeling pressure--such as Lebanon, Syria, and even Iraq or Iran. \\n\\nThis underlines the unusual potential finding that Iran itself may be more vulnerable than the Houthis. As U.S. Central Command\\'s General Erik Kurilla told Congress on March 7, 2024, the key to suppressing Iranian partner forces like the Houthis may come in the form of pressuring Iran itself to force the axis to back down (151)--a kind of inside-out approach in which Iran uses its soft power, its ideological leadership role within the axis, to convince a Houthi ceasefire (probably temporary) in the shipping lanes. If this turns out to be true, this would suggest that it may be easier to try to threaten \"the head of the octopus\" (152) (Iran) than to try to directly coerce its newest and most resilient and aggressive tentacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010), p. 189.\\n\\n(2) For a recent explainer on the axis, see Kian Sharifi, \"Iran\\'s \\'Axis Of Resistance\\': Different Groups, Same Goals,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, February 19, 2024.\\n\\n(3) Author\\'s geolocated incident dataset of the post-October 7 war.

Bennett is quoted as saying: \"The head of the octopus is much weaker, much more vulnerable and feeble, than its arms. So how foolish are we to engage in war with the arms when we could engage with the head?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Salmoni, Loidolt, and Wells note that the Houthis are known by a variety of names: \"the \\'Houthis\\' (al-Houthiyin), the \\'Houthi movement\\' (al-Haraka al-Houthiya), Houthist elements\\' (al-\\'anasir al-Houthiya), \\'Houthi supporters\\' (Ansar al-Houthi), or \\'Believing Youth Elements\\' (\\'Anasir al-Shabab al-Mu\\'min).\"\\n\\n(b) On January 19, 2021, the outgoing Trump administration designated the Houthi organizational institution Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), a step that the Biden administration almost immediately revoked on February 16, 2021. Since then, some Houthi leaders remained covered by older sanctions (and additional Houthi military leaders continue to be added to U.S. sanctions lists) for posing a \"threat to the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" Then on January 17, 2024, the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity but not as an FTO, a difference that enables easier access for humanitarian organizations and peace negotiators when the designation went into effect on February 17, 2024. For the newest SDGT designation, see \"Terrorist Designation of the Houthis: Press Statement by Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State,\" U.S. Department of State, January 17, 2024. For the prior sanctions, see \"Revocation of the Terrorist Designations of Ansarallah,\" U.S. Department of State, February 12, 2021. The U.S. government noted: \"Ansarallah leaders Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim remain sanctioned under E.O. 13611 related to acts that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" \\n\\n(c) One might look at the Israel July 20 attack on Houthi port facilities or the January 17, 2024, designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity as setbacks, but neither effort changed the Houthi behavior and the Houthis appear to have lost no senior leaders and no terrain since the war began, nor have they been notably economically damaged and the Houthi currency remains more stable than that of the internationally recognized government of Yemen. See \"The Economy,\" Yemen Review, April-June 2024.\\n\\n(d) There were two short pauses in Houthi anti-shipping attacks in 2024--April 9-24 and August 15-20--that are unexplained, though it is notable that these pauses coincided closely with periods of intense rain and flooding in Yemen, which tends to disrupt all military and non-military activities.\\n\\n(e) It is hard not to think of the movie boxer \"Rocky\" when looking at the fighting characteristics of the Houthis. Though this is charitable in the extreme--and does not reflect a sympathy for the Houthis--it is useful to view the Houthis in the Gaza war as an underdog boxer taking on much stronger opponents, whose aim may simply be to \"go the distance\" by supporting Hamas and the axis of resistance until the war ends (until the bell rings). Endurance and dogged pain aversion can be said to be characteristics of both the Houthis and the apocryphal Rocky Balboa.\\n\\n(f) This was the hope contained in this author\\'s assessment in his April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, which envisaged a triadic mechanism--increased usage and destruction of Houthi systems, compounded by tightened interdiction--slimming down Houthi arsenals.\\n\\n(g) The first phase, announced on November 14, 2023, called for attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea and on Israel proper. See Mohammed al-Harissi, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis vow to attack Israeli ships in Red Sea,\" National, November 14, 2023. The second phase, announced on December 9, 2023, declared Houthi intent to attack all ships headed to Israeli ports via the Red Sea. The third phase, announced after U.S./U.K. strikes on the Houthis on January 12, 2024, called for strikes on all U.S.- and U.K.-linked ships as well. Abdul Malik\\'s fourth phase was announced on May 3, 2024, broadened targeting to all ships whose owners or operators have visited Israeli ports. A fifth phase announced by Abdul Malik on July 21 was unclear in its expanded aims but seemed to focus more effort on Israel proper and its Mediterranean traffic and ports.\\n\\n(h) Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics suggest volume of shipping in the Red Sea dropped by 46 percent between November 2023 and February 2024, and has remained at these low levels since. Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics similarly suggest Bab el-Mandab transits dropped by 57 percent in the same comparison and stayed at this lower level since February 2024. Maritime Spotlight data; Lloyd\\'s List Intelligence presentation, August 9, 2024, provided to the author.\\n\\n(i) This study lists a number of cases in which Houthi attack claims do not appear to have been correct, notably attacks on the Mediterranean shipping and Indian Ocean vessels.  All the maritime attack case studies in this article draw upon the very useful Washington Institute Maritime Spotlight online tracker by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi.\\n\\n(j) In the author\\'s long study of the Houthi movement since the 2000s, a recurring feature is their keen eye for propaganda operations, about which the following listed authors dedicated entire chapters in their 2010 study. See Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010).\\n\\n(k) Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) also reports the interception of incoming attacks that are not counted by JMIC incident reporting. JMIC incidents are reported by shippers, who are not themselves witness to interceptions far away from their vessels. To give an example of the OPG intercept data, on September 24, 2024, a tweet released by @CENTCOM noted that \"U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed one Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicle over the Red Sea.\" See U.S. Central Command, \"Sept 24 U.S. Central Command Update: In the past 24 hours, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed...,\" X, September 24, 2024.\\n\\n(l) If JMIC and thus Maritime Spotlight are reliant on self-reporting of attacks by shippers, it stands to reason that some attacks will be simply not detected (neither intercepted nor landing close enough to a vessel to be noticed) or simply not revealed for some reason (perhaps insurance-related).\\n\\n(m) The United Kingdom takes part in Poseidon Archer planned joint strikes with the United States in Yemen, but it does not appear to mount preemptive \\'dynamic\\' (opportunistic) strikes on launchers ashore, which are all undertaken by the United States.\\n\\n(n) It is hard to tell sometimes whether a reported strike on a \"missile launcher\" is a preemptive U.S. action (as a missile is readied for launch, arguably counting as an \\'attack\\') or a strike on a storage site that cannot be considered an attack by Houthi forces. In the data collation in this piece, all such marginal or inconclusive cases are not counted as an attack.\\n\\n(o) Interestingly, the chart does appear to show a rise in Houthi attacks after the end of the extended presence of the USS Eisenhower and supporting escort vessels in the Red Sea from November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024. The Eisenhower returned to the Red Sea for a very intense period of Houthi attacks between May 6, 2024, and June 22, 2024, and there was no apparent downturn in attacks in that period. Since June 22, as later sections will detail (see \"Tactical Evolution\"), the Houthis seem to have exploited the reduction of U.S. presence. \\n\\n(p) On November 25, 2023, the Houthis claimed to strike an Israeli-linked container ship, CMA CGM Symi, in the Indian Ocean using a one-way attack drone, over 2,200 kilometers from the nearest Houthi-controlled area in Yemen. Considering the range, targeting support from Iran (in the form of the Safiz surveillance ship off the coast of India) is considered likely in this case. Details gathered from interviews with U.S. and U.K. military personnel for this study. \\n\\n(q) These include claimed attacks (all in 2024) on the Veracruz (April 24), MSC Vittoria 1 (May 7), MSC Alexandra (May 23), Aloraiq (June 1), and Anvil Point (July 1). \\n\\n(r) This includes all Houthi-claimed attacks launched either from Yemen or Iraq, which are likely to be comprehensive as the Houthis have a strong incentive to seek credit for such attacks. These Houthi-claimed attacks do not always result in confirmation of the attacks by Israel, particularly not when they are launched from Iraq. \\n\\n(s) The attack claims by IRI (including joint claims with the Houthis) often include videos of launches. The videos are not duplicated, being original each time, which is one indicator that attacks are genuinely being launched, but the lack of any supporting data means that it is still unclear whether all claimed attacks occur.\\n\\n(t) Very few Israeli press or government communiques give any insight into whether such IRI or IRI/Houthi-claimed projectiles reach Israel.\\n\\n(u) These are the claimed attacks on the Shorthorn Express (June 23), MSC Manazillo (June 26), Waler (June 28), the Ionnis (June 28), Lucky Sailor (July 1), and the Olvia (July 15). \\n\\n(v) These are the claimed attacks on the Destiny (May 15), the Essex (May 23), and the Minerva Antonia (May 29). The Essex, in particular, was quite far away from Israeli waters and docked at an Egyptian gas terminal at the time it was meant to be attacked near Israel. \\n\\n(w) The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) identified Houthi MRBMs used against Israel to be extended-range variant of the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar, known in Iran as Qiam/Rezvan. See the declassified dossier \"Iran: Enabling Houthi Attacks Across the Middle East,\" Defense Intelligence Agency, February 2024.\\n\\n(x) As many Chinese- and Russian-linked vessels have themselves visited Israeli ports in the past.\\n\\n(y) In the framework of great power competition, the Axis of Resistance clearly leans toward the non-U.S. bloc, led by China and Russia. In March 2023, Chinese and Russian diplomats reportedly sought Houthi guarantees that their shipping would not be hit in return for ongoing support to the Houthis in the UN Security Council. See Sam Dagher and Mohammed Hatem, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won\\'t Be Targeted,\" Bloomberg, March 21, 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n After the attack, Houthi spokesmen stated (incorrectly) that the vessel was attacked because it had British owners. \\n\\n After the attack, Houthi spokesmen stated (incorrectly) that the vessel was attacked because it had British owner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n See \"US Army Doctrine Reference Publication No. 3-05: Special Operations,\" U.S. Department of the Army, August 31, 2012, pp. \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n   The Houthis propagandized the carrier\\'s departure.

News reporting of Houthi foot soldiers being deployed to Syria might be a leading indicator of impoverished Yemeni recruits being used overseas to bolster axis member regime security.

That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April.

The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%).

This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Opinion: Houthis’ rising threat', 'metadata': [{'key': 'data_source_name', 'values': ['news']}, {'key': 'source_name', 'values': ['Telengana Today']}, {'key': 'top_language', 'values': ['en']}, {'key': 'vendor_id', 'values': ['moreover']}], 'published_date': '2024-11-21T18:32:53+00:00', 'matching_spans': [{}, {}, {}]}, {'document_id': 'bdb10418-0874-596d-b2bc-a868cfa767f9', 'text': \"Two US Navy destroyers were attacked by the Houthis on Monday.

DIA is the principal foreign intelligence source to the country’s combat-related missions.\\n\\n DIA report about the Red Sea crisis (https://www.portseurope.com/dia-report-about-the-red-sea-crisis/)\\n\\n DIA reports that at least 29 major energy and shipping companies have changed their routes to avoid Houthi attacks, and at least 65 countries’ interests have been affected. The report also contains graphics and tables about Houthi commercial shipping attacks and affected nations from November 2023 to March 2024.\\n\\n DIA report confirms the Houthis’ use of Iranian missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct attacks across the Middle East (https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/3662325/dia-report-confirms-the-houthis-use-of-iranian-missiles-and-unmanned-aerial-veh/)\\n\\n Shipping via the Red Sea typically accounts for 10-15% of international maritime trade. Effects have been less severe in other shipping sectors carrying commodities on bulkers and tankers. Alternate shipping routes around Africa add about 11,000 nautical miles, 1-2 weeks of transit time, and approximately $1 million in fuel costs for each voyage.\\n\\n Red Sea cargo transit sees sharp fall (https://www.portseurope.com/red-sea-cargo-transit-sees-sharp-fall/)\\n\\n However, for some shipping companies, the combined costs of crew bonuses, war risk insurance (roughly 1000% more than pre-war costs), and Suez transit fees make the additional time and financial costs of travelling around Africa less expensive by comparison. As of mid-February, insurance premiums for Red Sea transits have risen to 0.7-1.0% of a ship’s total value, compared to less than 0.1% before December 2023.\\n\\n Absurd Houthis claim about Mediterranean attack denied (https://www.portseurope.com/absurd-houthis-claim-about-mediterranean-attack-denied/)\\n\\n Iran, Hezbollah, Houthis…\\n\\n Iran, and its proxy Hezbollah, are backing and arming with drones and missiles the Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite movement that has been fighting Yemen’s Sunni-majority government since 2004. The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital Sanaa in 2014 and seized control over much of north Yemen by 2016.\\n\\n In early December 2023, the Houthis threatened to attack any ships that they believed were heading to Israeli ports, though many of their attacks both before and since have been against civilian ships with either tenuous or no known Israeli affiliations or port calls.\\n\\n FT: Western Mediterranean container ports congested by Red Sea crisis (https://www.portseurope.com/ft-western-mediterranean-container-ports-congested-by-red-sea-crisis/)\\n\\n Since mid-December 2023, the Houthis have also threatened to attack ships affiliated with the United States and its allies, including members of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational initiative to protect international freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.\\n\\n Houthi’s claim drone attack against ships in Israel’s Haifa port (https://www.portseurope.com/houthis-claim-drone-attack-against-ships-in-israels-haifa-port/)\\n\\n Houthi’s actions have damaged regional security, impeded international humanitarian relief efforts, and put stress on global maritime trade.

       "     'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery region of the world, particularly the Middle East, has been alarmed by the increase in bloodshed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Video shared by CENTCOM showed a strike on a Houthi truck by a MQ-9 “Reaper” drone.\\xa0\\n\\nThe action comes as a direct response to repeated and unlawful Houthi attacks on commercial shipping and military vessels. “These targeted operations aim to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners and international shipping,” a CENTCOM spokesperson stated.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces executed a series of precise airstrikes on multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities situated within Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, Nov. 9-10. \\n\\n\\n\\nCENTCOM also confirmed details of a previously reported incident involving the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance. Supported by Air Force and Navy aircraft, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers successfully intercepted a barrage of Houthi-launched weapons in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, neutralizing eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and four anti-ship cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe U.S. military reported no injuries or damage to its personnel or equipment during these operations.\\n\\n“CENTCOM remains vigilant in its efforts to safeguard maritime traffic in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,” the spokesperson added, emphasizing the command’s readiness to address any threats to regional stability.\\n\\nFor nearly a year, Iranian-backed Houthis have attacked commercial ships and naval forces in the Red Sea region, claiming solidarity with Palestinians. These strikes have disrupted shipping routes, forcing vessels to detour and increasing costs.\\n\\nIn response, U.S. forces have carried out numerous defensive attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, including one in October that involved the use of U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers targetting Houthi weapons storage facilities.\\n\\nUnlock Exclusive Insights Today!\\n\\nJoin the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.',\n",

       "     'text': '\\n\\nHoman named: Donald Trump has named Tom Homan to be in charge of the U.S. southern border and the country’s border with Canada during his administration beginning Jan. 20. Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans. King Charles and other members of the Royal Family also made appearances over the weekend. King Charles also has been treated for cancer. Queen Camilla did not appear in public and was said to be recovering from a chest infection.',\n",

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

       "     'title': 'The Houthis are winning in the Red Sea – rest of the world on the back foot',\n",
       "     'text': 'Who is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

       "      'text': '\\n\\nHoman named: Donald Trump has named Tom Homan to be in charge of the U.S. southern border and the country’s border with Canada during his administration beginning Jan. 20. Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans. King Charles and other members of the Royal Family also made appearances over the weekend. King Charles also has been treated for cancer. Queen Camilla did not appear in public and was said to be recovering from a chest infection.',\n",

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies.

Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes.

This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans. King Charles and other members of the Royal Family also made appearances over the weekend. King Charles also has been treated for cancer.

       "      'text': 'U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces have conducted precision airstrikes on Houthi weapons storage facilities in Yemen amid the group’s ongoing threats to international shipping in the Red Sea region.\\n\\nThe operation, carried out on November 9-10, targeted multiple facilities housing advanced conventional weapons used by the Iran-backed Houthis to threaten U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Video shared by CENTCOM showed a strike on a Houthi truck by a MQ-9 “Reaper” drone.\\xa0\\n\\nThe action comes as a direct response to repeated and unlawful Houthi attacks on commercial shipping and military vessels. “These targeted operations aim to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners and international shipping,” a CENTCOM spokesperson stated.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces executed a series of precise airstrikes on multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities situated within Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, Nov. 9-10. \\n\\n\\n\\nCENTCOM also confirmed details of a previously reported incident involving the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance. Supported by Air Force and Navy aircraft, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers successfully intercepted a barrage of Houthi-launched weapons in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, neutralizing eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and four anti-ship cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe U.S. military reported no injuries or damage to its personnel or equipment during these operations.\\n\\n“CENTCOM remains vigilant in its efforts to safeguard maritime traffic in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,” the spokesperson added, emphasizing the command’s readiness to address any threats to regional stability.\\n\\nFor nearly a year, Iranian-backed Houthis have attacked commercial ships and naval forces in the Red Sea region, claiming solidarity with Palestinians. These strikes have disrupted shipping routes, forcing vessels to detour and increasing costs.\\n\\nIn response, U.S. forces have carried out numerous defensive attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, including one in October that involved the use of U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers targetting Houthi weapons storage facilities.\\n\\nUnlock Exclusive Insights Today!\\n\\nJoin the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.',\n",

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

       "      'text': \"New York, United States (Ports Europe) October 27, 2024 - Under the headline Russia provided data for Houthi assault on global shipping (https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-provided-targeting-data-for-houthi-assault-on-global-shipping-eabc2c2b), the Wall Street Journal reported that Moscow provided targeting data for Iran-backed Yemen's Houthi rebels as they attacked Western ships in the Red Sea with missiles and drones earlier this year.\\n\\n The data was passed through members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who were embedded with the Houthis, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group, security sources told the newspaper.\\n\\n The assistance, which hasn't been previously reported, shows how far Russian President\\xa0Vladimir Putin\\xa0 is willing to go to undermine the U.S.-led Western economic and political order.\\xa0According to analysts quoted by the WSJ, Russia\\xa0has sought to stoke instability from the Middle East to Asia to create problems for the U.S. and distract the world's attention away from Ukraine.\\n\\n \\n\\n As of mid-February, container shipping through the Red Sea had declined by approximately 90% compared to December 2023, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) July’s “Report that Details Effects of Houthi Attacks on Commercial Shipping” said. DIA is the principal foreign intelligence source to the country’s combat-related missions.\\n\\n DIA report about the Red Sea crisis (https://www.portseurope.com/dia-report-about-the-red-sea-crisis/)\\n\\n DIA reports that at least 29 major energy and shipping companies have changed their routes to avoid Houthi attacks, and at least 65 countries’ interests have been affected.

       "      'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery region of the world, particularly the Middle East, has been alarmed by the increase in bloodshed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops.

Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors.

This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

       "      'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery region of the world, particularly the Middle East, has been alarmed by the increase in bloodshed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Video shared by CENTCOM showed a strike on a Houthi truck by a MQ-9 “Reaper” drone.\\xa0\\n\\nThe action comes as a direct response to repeated and unlawful Houthi attacks on commercial shipping and military vessels. “These targeted operations aim to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners and international shipping,” a CENTCOM spokesperson stated.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces executed a series of precise airstrikes on multiple Houthi weapons storage facilities situated within Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, Nov. 9-10. \\n\\n\\n\\nCENTCOM also confirmed details of a previously reported incident involving the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance. Supported by Air Force and Navy aircraft, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers successfully intercepted a barrage of Houthi-launched weapons in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, neutralizing eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and four anti-ship cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe U.S. military reported no injuries or damage to its personnel or equipment during these operations.\\n\\n“CENTCOM remains vigilant in its efforts to safeguard maritime traffic in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,” the spokesperson added, emphasizing the command’s readiness to address any threats to regional stability.\\n\\nFor nearly a year, Iranian-backed Houthis have attacked commercial ships and naval forces in the Red Sea region, claiming solidarity with Palestinians. These strikes have disrupted shipping routes, forcing vessels to detour and increasing costs.\\n\\nIn response, U.S. forces have carried out numerous defensive attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, including one in October that involved the use of U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers targetting Houthi weapons storage facilities.\\n\\nUnlock Exclusive Insights Today!\\n\\nJoin the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.',\n",

       "      'text': '\\n\\nHoman named: Donald Trump has named Tom Homan to be in charge of the U.S. southern border and the country’s border with Canada during his administration beginning Jan. 20. Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans. King Charles and other members of the Royal Family also made appearances over the weekend. King Charles also has been treated for cancer. Queen Camilla did not appear in public and was said to be recovering from a chest infection.',\n",

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising.

She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again.

From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

       "      'title': 'The Houthis are winning in the Red Sea – rest of the world on the back foot',\n",
       "      'text': 'Who is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

       "    'text': 'Egypt shares a land border with Israel and Gaza, and has been the gateway for aid to enter Gaza and for refugees to leave. It means that for anyone planning a trip to this north African country, the Israel-Hamas war will be a key concern, especially as fighting has also intensified between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.\\n\\nOn October 26, Israel carried out military action against Iran. Dozens of fighter jets hit Iranian ballistic missile production facilities, missile launchers and air defence batteries in an attack that was codenamed “Days of Repentance”. The attacks were in retaliation to the events on October 1, when Iran launched around 180 missiles at Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had warned of “consequences” after the attack.\\n\\nBut while it’s geographically close to the conflict, the UK Foreign Office does not advise against travel to the main tourist areas of Egypt. However, there are large parts of the country that the UK Foreign Office does warn against travelling to. There are also safety considerations to bear in mind even when you’re travelling to the main tourist areas.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to the Middle East right now?\\n\\nWhat’s the latest government advice about travelling to Egypt?\\n\\nThere are no travel advisories in place for popular tourist spots in Egypt such as Cairo, cities along the Nile including Luxor and Aswan, and resorts by the Red Sea such as Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada. These are all considered safe by the UK government.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt on October 26 following Israel’s attacks on Iran. It warns ongoing hostilities in the Middle East could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai, which includes the crossing at Rafah, and within 20km of the Egyptian/Libyan border (excluding El Salloum, where it advises against all but essential travel).\\n\\nIt also advises against all but essential travel to the following areas:\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing US and UK strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, the Foreign Office said: “Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that travel advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor travel advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.”\\n\\nThis advice is still current and has not changed since the Iranian missile attack on Israel.\\n\\nSeparately, the Foreign Office has warned that terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, and targets could include destinations popular with tourists. Most attacks in the past have been in the North Sinai region, but they may take place in other parts of the country too.\\n\\nThe risk is heightened during public holidays and festivals, such as Christmas and Ramadan, and is particularly high around religious sites, large public gatherings and places frequented by foreigners. Stay vigilant and carry your photo ID with you at all times.\\n\\nHas Egypt been affected by the conflict in the Middle East?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn September 29, the UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Egypt, saying: “Ongoing hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region. Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.”\\n\\nSharing a border with both Israel and Gaza has meant that Egypt is closer to the conflict than any other nation. On October 27, 2023, an official confirmed that a drone fell near a medical facility in the Red Sea resort of Taba, near the Israeli border, injuring six people.\\n\\nSeparately, two Israeli tourists and their local guide died after a police officer opened fire on a group of Israeli tourists in Alexandria on October 8, 2023, according to reports by the Israeli foreign ministry. This has not been confirmed by Egyptian authorities.\\n\\nMore generally, the Foreign Office warns that the border between Israel and Egypt at Taba could close at short notice. Visitors should check with local authorities before trying to cross. It also warns that since the Israel-Hamas war started, demonstrations (often at short notice) have taken place. Tourists should be vigilant and avoid large gatherings and protests.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is currently closed. The Foreign Office says that when this border is reopened, Israel, Egypt and the authorities in Gaza may determine procedures for who is permitted to cross and when. Humanitarian aid workers cannot enter or exit Gaza through Egypt at this time.\\n\\n Is it safe to travel to Israel right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Turkey right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Dubai right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Cyprus right now?\\n Is it safe to travel to Morocco right now?\\n\\nIs Cairo safe?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Cairo and this advice has not changed since the US and UK joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen in January and February 2024, nor after the increased air strikes between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024.\\n\\nHowever, it’s a big and busy city so it’s still worth staying vigilant for petty crime. Female travellers should also take care — as in other parts of the country, harassment and sexual assault can and do happen.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nSharm el-Sheikh reopened to British tourists in October 2019, four years after a bomb exploded on a Russian plane carrying 224 tourists and crew. Security measures were increased at the Red Sea resort: x-ray scanners in hotels, security walls and high perimeter fences around the airport were installed.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office no longer advises against travel to the area of Sharm el-Sheikh. This advice has not changed since the US and UK launched joint strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen at the beginning of 2024.\\n\\nFor context, the attacks in the Red Sea have been limited to the south, while the Egyptian Red Sea resorts are in the north, more than 1,000 miles away.\\n\\nIs it safe to travel to Hurghada?\\n\\nThe Foreign Office does not advise against travel to Hurghada, a popular Red Sea resort. Again, travel advice has not been amended for the resort following the strikes on the Houthi bases in Yemen, nor after the intensified fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you drink alcohol in Egypt?\\n\\nEgypt is an Islamic country. While attitudes are more relaxed in tourist resorts, customs can be very different elsewhere and more strict during Ramadan. Public drinking, for example, can lead to arrest — alcohol is only permitted in a licensed restaurant or bar.\\n\\nPossession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs can lead to long prison sentences or even the death penalty. Visitors should be aware that what is legal in the UK may not be legal in Egypt. In 2017, for example, a British woman was jailed for three years for taking painkillers into the country. Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is a prescription drug in the UK but is illegal in Egypt.\\n\\nWhat about taking photos in Egypt?\\n\\nBe aware of what you’re photographing. Taking pictures of military installations (strictly prohibited), embassies, government buildings, churches and even infrastructure such as train stations can lead to arrest. If you want to photograph any Egyptian citizens, you must have written permission from them; photographing children is not permitted.\\n\\nTaking or sharing photographs that are perceived to be damaging to the country’s image is also forbidden. Similarly, making strongly negative comments about Egypt or its politics, including on social media, can lead to you being detained.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are Egypt’s entry restrictions?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor entry into Egypt, you’ll need at least six months of validity on your passport. You’ll also need to apply for a tourist visa to visit most of the country. These can be obtained online before you travel or on arrival at dedicated desks inside the airport. This is valid for up to three months.\\n\\nIf you’re travelling to the resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba or Taba, you can get a free entry permission stamp upon arrival for stays of up to 15 days. You’ll have to get a visa if you want to stay longer or visit other places.\\n\\nDo I need vaccines for Sharm el-Sheikh?\\n\\nThere are no essential vaccine requirements for visiting Egypt. However, the NHS suggests that it’s advisable to have polio and tetanus jabs. You may also want to consider hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies and typhoid.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of safety on the ground, it pays to be vigilant. Protests take place frequently and foreigners taking part in political activities in the country could be detained or subjected to other measures.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office says: “If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the immediate area as the atmosphere could change quickly and without warning. Police have previously used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition for crowd control.”\\n\\nAt popular tourist spots, visitors can be harassed for money or to buy things. There’s also a risk of theft and mugging, even in taxis. Travelling as part of an escorted tour can help reduce the risks. If you are a victim of crime, you should contact the local tourist police who can help you make a report.\\n\\nPublic displays of affection can also be frowned upon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for female travellers?\\n\\nIn general, yes, it is safe for female travellers. However, there have been reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment in the country, including some affecting minors. Most of the reported incidents have taken place in the Red Sea region and, according to the Foreign Office, are often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff.\\n\\nThe Foreign Office advises: “Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.”\\n\\n What can women do to stay safe while abroad?\\n\\nIs Egypt safe for LGBT travellers?\\n\\nIt can be problematic for LGBT travellers. While homosexuality is not technically illegal in Egypt, according to the Foreign Office, the charges of “debauchery” and “sexual deviance” have been used to prosecute LGBT people in the past. Dozens of people were arrested in 2017 on debauchery charges after waving a rainbow flag at a concert in Cairo, for example. Again, attitudes are more relaxed in tourist areas but public displays of affection are likely to cause issues.\\n\\n Is it safe to go diving in the Red Sea?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'text': ' The arbitrary arrests appear to be based on the detainees’ present or past employment.\\n\\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, carried out these arbitrary arrests while widespread hunger and thirst remain rampant across Yemen, including in areas they control, and during a recent, major cholera outbreak that the Houthis hid for several months, based on ongoing Human Rights Watch research.\\n\\n“The Houthis are using arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances as a political tool at a time when the people living in their territories lack even the most basic needs,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Houthis should immediately release all of these people, many of whom have spent their careers working to improve their country.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch spoke to 20 people with knowledge of the arrests, as well as 4 Yemen analysts. Their identities are not being revealed for their safety, as they fear reprisals. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents, videos, social media, and media reports, voice recordings, and other materials relevant to the detentions.\\n\\nHouthi forces did not present search or arrest warrants at the time of arrest, and the authorities have refused to tell families where those arrested are being held, meaning that these acts amount to enforced disappearances. They have held detainees incommunicado, without access to lawyers or their families. On June 19, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Houthi human rights office with questions regarding the arrests and concerns about the apparent absence of any due process. The Houthis have not responded.\\xa0\\n\\nAs far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, no charges have been brought against the people detained. However, Houthi authorities have a long history of bringing dubious charges against detained people, including espionage.\\n\\nStarting on June 10, Houthi authorities released a series of videos and curated social media posts on the Houthi-affiliated TV channel, Al-Masirah, and its related social media platforms. These show 10 Yemeni men who were detained between 2021 and 2023. Most of them have been held incommunicado.\\n\\nThe videos show the men confessing that they were spying for the United States and Israel, but there is a high risk that these confessions were coerced. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain confessions. Publishing videos of confessions undermines the right to fair trial and lacks credibility.\\n\\nThough the Houthis have not said whether the current arrests are linked to the videos and their related announcements of uncovering a “spy network,” sources, including analysts, said that they feared that the Houthis were trying to frame the recently detained people as spies.\\n\\nYemen analysts interviewed by Human Rights Watch also suggested political motives for the arrests. The Yemeni government-controlled central bank issued a decision on May 30 to end transactions with six banks within Houthi territories that refused to move their headquarters to Aden, which is under the control of the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). The decision has the potential for a significant negative economic impact on Houthi-controlled territories. Analysts said that the arrests may be an attempt to put pressure on the Yemeni government to reverse the decision.\\n\\nEnforced disappearances, in which the authorities detain a person and then refuse to acknowledge their whereabouts or situation when asked, are serious crimes under international law and are prohibited at all times under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\\n\\nAll of the detainees are Yemenis. The Houthis have told families not to speak out about the detention of their family members, in many cases saying that detainees will be released as soon as the Houthis have completed their interrogations, as long as they do not find anything.\\n\\n“[The Houthis] know there will not be an [international] escalation from the arrest of the Yemenis, but if they arrested international staff there will be a huge escalation from the international community,” said one source.\\n\\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, have called for the release of all UN and nongovernmental organization staff, as have other senior UN officials.\\n\\nHowever, some sources also told Human Rights Watch that the UN agencies or organizations where detainees had been working had not made efforts to contact detainees’ families, including those living abroad who could have been safely reached.\\xa0\\n\\n“Continuing to work like business as usual cannot be done,” a source said. “The abductees that were part of the confessions yesterday, there was no huge demand for their release, barely anything was said by UN agencies,” referring to those shown in videos.\\xa0\\n\\nOne political analyst said that “he wider weak international reaction … proves that from [the Houthis’] perspective, they did the right thing.”\\n\\nIt is imperative for the United Nations, independent groups working in Yemen, and concerned governments to take every action in their power to ensure the release of those detained, Human Rights watch said. Oman, which has been a mediator in negotiations between the Houthis and other warring parties, should work with other countries collectively to ensure that the Houthis release the detainees.\\n\\n“The international community should be doing everything in their power to ensure that these people are immediately released,” Jafarnia said. “Many of them have been invaluable members of Yemeni civil society organizations and staff in UN agencies and nongovernmental international groups.”\\n\\nBased on interviews with informed sources, Human Rights Watch found that, starting on the morning of Friday, May 31, Houthi forces began arresting employees of several nongovernmental organizations, raiding their homes and offices, though a few arrests were before that date. According to one source, more than 60 people had been arrested as of June 12.\\n\\nIn one case, the Houthis also detained the husband and two children – a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old – of a woman who works with a civil society organization, a source said.\\n\\nIn all but one case, Houthi forces did not tell relatives where they were taking the person arrested, and none have had contact with their family members since they were arrested, as far as Human Rights Watch could determine. With the exception of one case, the authorities did not tell relatives where their loved ones have been detained when asked. Such conditions amount to enforced disappearance.\\n\\nOn June 18, Volker Türk said that the six staff members from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) who had been detained “have not had contact with their families, nor has the UN been able to access them.” In separate statements, he added that two other staff, who have been “held incommunicado, without any due process,” and two staff from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), had “already been arbitrarily detained for a lengthy period.”\\n\\n“I can’t even describe the fear and concern that all of these people had for their safety and well-being,” one source said. “[The head of one organization] couldn’t eat for an entire week.”\\xa0\\n\\nWhile the conditions of those disappeared remains unknown, many sources said that the Houthis had not allowed family members to send needed medicines for the detainees, including for serious medical conditions. Human Rights Watch has documented the Houthis’ use of torture in detention since 2015.\\n\\nSince the initial raids and arrests on May 31 and June 6, the Houthis have continued arresting people, prompting many people in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to flee their territory.\\xa0\\n\\nOne person who left Sanaa said, “Although I managed to flee.… I couldn’t sleep … I’ve had panic attacks every day since I fled from Sanaa … I’m very worr[ied] about my friends and colleagues in Sanaa who are just waiting for Houthis to arrest them.”\\xa0\\n\\n',\n",

The movemenent attacks in the Red Sea target commercial vessels, including oil tankers, to disrupt trade and assert influence, using explosive-laden boats, naval mines, and alleged Iranian-supplied missiles. The Houthis have committed severe human rights violations, including child soldier recruitment, detainee abuse, forced marriages, hostage-taking, aid diversion, and repression of women and LGBTQ+ individuals, according to the UN and human rights groups.  \\nThe operation underscores Russia’s efforts to avoid full mobilization as casualties rise, with the country also recruiting mercenaries from Nepal and India, while some 12,000 North Korean regular army troops have arrived in Kursk Oblast for combat against Ukrainian forces, FT says. \\n \\nAccording to FT, the Yemeni recruits are promised high-paying jobs and Russian citizenship, but upon arrival are forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to Ukraine’s front lines with the help of a Houthi-linked company. This mirrors schemes previously used to deceive Indian nationals into fighting against Ukraine. \\n \\nThe Financial Times reports that US special envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed Russia is engaging with the Houthis, discussing weapons transfers that could enhance their ability to threaten ships in the Red Sea and beyond, with Russian personnel present in Sana’a to support these talks. \\n \\nThe Financial Times revealed that Yemeni recruits, many untrained and tricked into traveling to Russia, were coerced into signing military enlistment contracts upon arrival, with promises of high salaries and citizenship. The operation, linked to a company founded by prominent Houthi politician Abdulwali Abdo Hassan al-Jabri, reportedly began in July. Maged Almadhaji of the Sana’a Center noted Russia’s interest in groups hostile to the US in the Red Sea region, while Ansar Allah politburo member Mohammed al Bukhaiti confirmed ongoing ties with Russian leadership across military, economic, and political domains. \\n \\nEleven Yemenis were recently allowed to leave Russia for Yemen via Oman, following pressure from the International Federation of Yemeni Migrants after a public outcry, but hundreds of Yemenis remain in Russia, according to FT sources. \\n \\n \\n  Ukraine builds new brigades instead of reinforcing old units.  \\n  Putin’s willingness to arm Houthis aims to deter Western support for Ukraine – ISW  European Parliament: release Galaxy Leader crew, including Ukrainians, captured by Houthis    You could close this page.

       "    'text': 'In the year since the October 7, 2023, atrocities, Yemen\\'s Houthi movement (1 a) is arguably (in the author\\'s view) the \"Axis of Resistance\" (2) member that has gained the most newfound recognition on the global stage. It was the Houthis who committed most quickly to support Hamas after October 7, including their dramatic October 31, 2023, launch of the first-ever medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) against Israel by a member of the Axis of Resistance, Iran included. (3) Among the axis, only the Houthis--formally known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), and (since February 17, 2024) once again sanctioned by the United States for terrorism (b)--have struck and sunk commercial ships in support of Hamas. (4) After a year of notable setbacks for the axis--loss of terrain and leaders by Hamas, (5) the deaths of Iranian and Iraqi commanders, (6) an underwhelming Iranian strategic strike on Israel, (7) heavy leadership losses for Hezbollah (including overall leader Hassan Nasrallah), (8) and now Israeli ground incursions into Lebanon (9)--the Houthis have arguably weathered the year of war without suffering major setbacks. \\n\\nThis study aims to update the April 2024 study in CTC Sentinel, (10) which looked in detail at the Houthi war effort against Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and global shipping from October 2023 to a data cut-off of April 11, 2024. (11) This article also builds on two other foundational CTC Sentinel pieces: the September 2018 analysis (12) of the military evolution of the movement and the October 2022 study (co-authored with Adnan Jabrani and Casey Coombs) (13) that provided an in-depth profile of the Houthi p0litical-military leadership, its core motivations, and the considerable extent of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah influence within the movement. \\n\\nThe sections below will take forward (to the time of writing (October 1, 2024, for news events, and an attack data cut-off of August 31, 2024)) the analysis of the military development of the Houthi movement. The analysis will draw on open-source reporting of Houthi military activities, which includes vast amounts of marine traffic analysis, social media, and broadcast media imagery, and U.S. and U.K. government announcements regarding military operations. The piece will also draw heavily on the collation and analysis work undertaken by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\\'s Maritime Spotlight platform, (15) which maps and analyses Houthi attacks on shipping, and the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC), run by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). (16) Some data has been drawn from contacts in Western naval and intelligence services, and from contacts in Yemen with extensive on-the-ground access in Houthi-held areas.\\n\\nThe article starts by summarizing the trends visible in Houthi military activities in the second half of the post-October 7 period, from April to September 2024. With the broad outlines set, a detailed analysis follows. Houthi military performance will be dissected in terms of the operational tempo of Houthi attacks, the geographic reach demonstrated in Houthi strikes, and the evolution of Houthi tactics and preferred weapons systems. Special focus will be directed at the issue of why the Houthis strike the ships they do, with a view to better understanding the real level of intentionality (or otherwise) in Houthi targeting of specific vessels. The article will conclude with assessment of the impact of U.S.-led military operations to protect shipping and an update to the April 2024 CTC Sentinel assessment of the Houthi movement\\'s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe overall trend in the Houthi war effort since the last CTC Sentinel analysis in April, and more broadly across the entire postOctober 2024 period, has been the successful continuation and improvement of Houthi attacks on shipping and on Israel. Despite the commitment of significant U.S., European, and Indian naval forces, the Houthi anti-shipping campaign was not suspended at any point. (d) Escalating U.S. and U.K. military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen also did not end the Houthi anti-shipping campaign or even significantly reduce its operational tempo. (18) If anything, in the author\\'s view, the Houthis have arguably improved their effectiveness and efficiency as the war has progressed, by learning lessons and taking advantage of fluctuating U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea. In the manner of an underdog boxer trying to \\'go the distance\\' to the final bell, (e) the Houthis have shown resilience and resisted a superpower\\'s effort to suppress their anti-shipping campaign. The Houthis also weathered a heavy Israeli retaliatory strike on one of their two main port complexes and continued to attack Israel. If, as the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article assessed, (19) the Houthi aim is to vault to the front ranks of the Axis of Resistance by demonstrating fearlessness and pain tolerance in support of Hamas and in opposition to Israel and the U.S.-U.K. coalition, (20) then the Houthis have succeeded. From the perspective of Ansar Allah\\'s leaders, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis may see themselves as the main winners in the post-October 2023 conflict.\\n\\nAs the following sections will dissect in detail, the Houthis can claim to have maintained a broadly consistent operational tempo against shipping, with an apparent surge of effort in June and July 2024--precisely at the point that the U.S.-led international effort might have hoped the Houthi arsenals would be emptying and their pace of attacks reducing. (f) In this author\\'s view, as the below sections will outline, the resilience of Houthi domestic drone and drone boat production has been demonstrated, as has the movement\\'s line of supply to Iran-provided experts and resupply of irreplaceable Iran-sourced materiel. (21) As this article evidences below, many of the Houthi\\'s claims--of extended-range attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean or the Mediterranean--appear unfounded and perhaps deliberately falsified, but the Houthis have nonetheless spread growing fear that they can attack shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthi capacity to precisely identify, find, track, and strike ships by their owner\\'s nationality or ties to Israel may have been greatly overstated, but there are signs that the Houthis are gradually improving their targeting effort. In the author\\'s view (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the tactical sophistication of Houthi attacks is also steadily increasing from a very low initial base, aided by their ability to operate small boat flotillas in close proximity to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping lanes.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) from the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (22) it is sobering to note that assessed Houthi weaknesses--such as the technical deficiencies of their anti-shipping attacks and air defenses--may be less apparent now. Other exploitable Houthi weaknesses, such as their extended maritime line of supply to Iran and related smuggling networks, have not yet been effectively addressed by their adversaries. Regarding potential threats facing the Houthis, Iran has not been effectively levered into making the Houthis cease their attacks; nor has more united Yemeni opposition been aided to present a more urgent land warfare threat to the Houthis that might divert effort and attention from anti-shipping operations. As a result, in this author\\'s view, the Houthis can look back at the last year of war with satisfaction: Their position has strengthened, enemy countermeasures have been weathered, and they have no imminent threats on the horizon. This strongly suggests that the Houthis will sustain their anti-shipping and antiIsrael attacks as long as a Gaza and/or Lebanon war continues, if not beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthi military campaign has gone through some distinct stages since October 2023, often (but not always) reflected in the \"phases\" announced by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi. (g) The key trend has been a Houthi effort to sustain or increase their attacks on shipping and on Israel proper, despite obstacles such as U.S./U.K. airstrikes on launchers or the declining number of shippers using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (h) The liberal Houthi claiming policy, which either accidentally or deliberately appears to claim attacks that have not happened, (i) hints at their desire to maximize the apparent tempo, reach, and impact of their attacks. With a strong historic focus on propaganda operations, causing the impression of attacks may be as useful to the Houthis as the number of real attacks itself. \\n\\nAssessing how many attacks the Houthis have sent into the shipping lanes is an imprecise art because one must factor in both proven and strongly suspected completed attacks (evidenced by hits or near-misses on ships) (23) but also strongly suspected un-completed attacks (evidenced by the interception of inbound attacks by naval vessels in the shipping lanes). (k) Most collators of attack metrics versus commercial ships (such as JMIC and Maritime Spotlight) count only completed attacks on commercial ships. By slotting together JMIC incident data and other shipping data (collated by Maritime Spotlight) with the intercept data, one can gain a fuller picture of how many attacks the Houthis actually launch.\\n\\nFigure 1 includes the Maritime Spotlight-reported strikes on shipping, (24) fused with an additional set of intercepted attacks gathered in the author\\'s own dataset of U.S., U.K., and European-claimed interceptions in the shipping lanes. (25) Even then, these composite figures are probably a slight underreporting of actual strikes, as some attacks will be missed completely by collators, (l) and some attacks are disrupted in the launch phase by U.S. strikes (m) in Yemen but may be confused with strikes on storage sites where the weapons are not being readied for use against shipping at that moment. \\n\\nWith these caveats noted, the below statistics tell a story of relative consistency in Houthi anti-shipping efforts, with an upward step-change of attacks in the summer of 2024. (26) What the chart clearly does not show is a steady decline in Houthi attack activity in the face of international countermeasures--even during periods of constant U.S. aircraft carrier presence in the Red Sea (November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024, and May 6, 2024, to June 22, 2024). (o) The percentage of completed attacks is 38 percent, averaged across the entire coverage period, with minimal variation across the period, suggesting a large proportion of intercepts (especially of slower-moving Houthi drones). \\n\\nAs well as wanting to be seen to sustain the tempo of their attacks, the Houthis also took pains to portray their geographic reach as ever-expanding. A new phase of claimed long-range strikes started in March 2024, with Houthi communiques threatening to strike out across the Indian Ocean basin as far south as the Cape of Good Hope off South Africa. (28) At the start of the Gaza war, there were two anti-shipping attacks on Israel-linked vessels in the eastern Indian Ocean: drone attacks on the CMA CGM Symi (November 24, 2023) and the Chem Pluto (December 23, 2024), both of which occurred closer to India than to Yemen and which may have employed Iranian naval and intelligence assets rather than Houthi ones. (p) Closer to Yemen, the Houthis did undertake three attacks on vessels at the eastern and southern edges of the Gulf of Aden: one near Djibouti (MSC Orion, April 26, 2024), and two east of Socotra (MSC Sarah V of June 24, 2024, and Maersk Sentosa, July 9, 2024). (29) A rash of claimed attacks in the eastern Indian Ocean by the Houthis appear to be erroneous or deliberately falsified. (q) A concatenation of these events put a chill on Indian Ocean shipping and resulted in some shipping lines taking longer mid-ocean routes to avoid the Yemeni and Horn of African littoral. (30) As has often been the case, an inflated perception of Houthi capability and aggressiveness may have achieved the effect the Houthis were seeking.\\n\\n\\n\\nHouthi attacks against Israel itself were never numerous and have become rarer as the war has dragged on. Direct Houthi attacks on Israel were most numerous in November 2023, with five attacks in that month following the first-ever MRBM attack on Israel by an \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member on October 31, 2024. Thereafter, Houthi-claimed direct attacks on Israel averaged just three per month in December 2023 to August 2024. \\n\\n (32) The Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) (33) began to jointly claim attacks on Israel from June 6, 2024, onward. (34) The IRI is an online brand used since October 2023 to gather together and anonymize the claims of Iran-backed militants in Iraq as they attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, purportedly in connection to the Gaza war. (35) From June 6 to July 15, IRI and the Houthis (the latter using the moniker \"Yemeni Armed Forces\") jointly claimed six long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, plus four attacks on Israeli onshore port facilities in Eilat, Haifa, and Ashdod. (36) These attacks appear to be servicing Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s May 3 instruction to commence the fourth phase of the anti-shipping war in which any ships interacting with Israeli ports should be struck--not only those closest to the Houthis in Eilat but also those interacting with Israel\\'s Mediterranean ports. \\n\\nAs is the case with more than 169 drone and missile attacks on Israeli land targets solely claimed by the IRI (at the time of writing on September 24, 2024), (38) it is almost impossible to verify that these Houthi-IRI launches occurred, (s) and it appears likely (based on multi-source analysis) that very few of the attacks reached Israel. (t) As attacks on shipping are more likely to be reported (via systems like JMIC), it might be expected that more evidence would exist of the six Houthi-IRI-claimed long-range attacks on Israel-linked ships in Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters or harbors, (u) yet these also cannot be confirmed. (39) An earlier set of three Houthi-claimed (i.e., without IRI) long-range strikes on Israel-linked ships in the eastern Mediterranean in the May 15-29, 2024, period also do not correspond with maritime security incident reporting, casting doubt on the fidelity of the claims. (v) However, the June 30, 2024, killing of a mid-level Houthi officer (by a U.S. airstrike) at a drone or missile launch site in Iraq does lend additional credence to the claims of Houthi-IRI joint operations. \\n\\nWhile Houthi attacks on Israel have been sporadic and ineffective, they have occasionally been spectacular. MRBM strikes were launched on Israel on June 3 (41) and July 21 (42) (both on Eilat), and September 17. The latter case was claimed by the Houthis as the first MRBM (out of seven efforts) to penetrate Israel\\'s Arrow and Iron Dome systems, (43) with either a whole missile or intercepted debris falling in an area 15 kilometers from Ben Gurion airport and 25 kilometers from Tel Aviv--wounding nine people in this civilian area, (44) which neither Iran nor Hezbollah has attacked since the Gaza war started. (45) Though the MRBM was claimed to be a new \"hypersonic\" design by the Houthis, (46) there has been no Israeli or Western admission of a hypersonic attack, and it was more likely an extended-range supersonic MRBM such as the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar. (w) Since then, one more MRBM was fired by the Houthis at Israel (on September 27, 2024), again being intercepted. \\n\\nA final notable Houthi strike on Israel was the July 19, 2024, drone attack on the center 0f Tel Aviv, which killed one Israeli civilian and injured at least four--once again, an action that neither Iran nor Hezbollah has dared to take since the outset of the Gaza war. (48) The drone, named Jaffa by the Houthis (the Arabic name for the Tel Aviv area) was an extended-range Iranian-made Sammad-3 drone. (49) The drone penetrated Israel\\'s battle-tested, low-level defenses by arriving from the west, over the Mediterranean coast, after apparently having taken a very long route via the African continent. (50) U.S. and Israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed that it traveled via Eritrea, Sudan, and Egypt, thus avoiding the picket line of U.S. and European air defense vessels in the Suez area, and bypassing Israel\\'s own main southfacing defenses. (51) While the tactical surprise generated by the intricate and well-planned flightpath will be difficult to replicate, the incident demonstrated the higher-end of Houthi technical capability, potentially utilizing Iranian or Hezbollah route planning assistance, in this author\\'s view. In finding a new--but fleeting--way to penetrate Israeli defenses, the July 19, 2024, drone attack on Tel Aviv is reminiscent of the March 19, 2024, cruise missile strike on Eilat, (52) another \\'first\\' where successful penetration was enabled by elaborate route planning, that time via central Iraq and Jordan airspace. \\n\\nIsrael\\'s powerful counterstrike to the Tel Aviv drone attack--Operation Outstretched Arm, the July 20, 2024, destruction of a significant portion of the Houthi oil storage infrastructure at Hodeida (54)--was probably painful to the Houthis, as was the September 29, 2024, follow-on strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa ports. (55) However, these blows also (in the author\\'s view) brought the Houthis attention and recognition as the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' member hitting Israel the hardest and in the most novel and spectacular ways. (56) The July 21 Houthi MRBM strike at Israel was one immediate response to the July 20, 2024, Hodeida strike, (57) and another was Abdul Malik al-Houthi\\'s statement the same day that the fifth phase of Houthi military operations in the current war would involve moving \"to a new level of anti-Israel operations.\" (58) He added that the \"Yemeni people are pleased to be in direct confrontation with the Israeli enemy.\" (59) A new September 27, 2024, MRBM strike on Israel drew a further September 29, 2024, Israeli strike on Hodeida and Ras Issa. \\n\\n\\n\\nSince November 2023, risk analysts, shipping companies, and insurers have all put a great deal of effort into understanding why the Houthis do or do not target vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (61) The Houthi clearly employ a kind of elective and selective targeting because only a tiny proportion of ships using the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have been targeted. For example, there was still an average of 852 ships a month transiting the Bab el-Mandab in February to August 2024, (62) the level at which the Red Sea reset after an initial drop from pre-war levels of over 2,100 ship transits each month. (63) Of these 850-odd transits, (64) the Houthis have, in the most intense month of attacks in June 2024, completed or attempted attacks on only 4.9 percent of ships. (65) That means 95.1 percent of ships transited the Red Sea without being attacked in that month, (66) underlining the manner in which the Houthis have a very large universe of potential targets to choose from, even when the Red Sea is less busy.\\n\\nHow do the Houthis choose their targets out of this mass of ships?  \\n\\nAll of these categorizations require a degree of knowledge about the ownership, management, and vessel movement and port visits of commercial shipping. This data can be gained from open-source websites, but care and experience are required to differentiate between current and outdated information. As noted by Maritime Spotlight founding editor Noam Raydan, the Houthis appear to have started the war with knowledge about shipping lines and vessels that Iran had previously linked to Israeli owners and Israeli management--and which Iran had often targeted in the Persian Gulf in the 2019-2023 period. (71) To this short list, the Houthis also added new research on shipping assets linked to Israel and then (after January 12, 2024) also ships linked to the United States and the United Kingdom. (72) In the fourth phase of anti-shipping attacks undertaken since May 3, 2024, the Houthis will have needed to try to identify vessels not directly involved in Israeli trade but owned or managed by companies and individuals with apparent business in Israel or even personal connections to Israel. (73) The number of vessels tangentially linked to Israel, the United States, or the United Kingdom provides a very wide set of target options.\\n\\nThe broadening net of targets authorized by Abdul Malik al-Houthi has also included many Russian-linked and Chinese-linked vessels. (x) These great powers should, in theory, be well-positioned to negotiate safe passage due to their geopolitical alignment with the anti-Western \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' (y) yet they have both seen their cargos and vessels attacked repeatedly. (z) One reason may be the sheer availability of such targets: As the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted, nearly 74 percent of the southbound Red Sea oil traffic in the first half of 2023, (74) just before the war started, was made up of Russian oil cargos carried by the so-called \"dark fleet,\" often headed to East Asia. (75) As LNG tankers and major global shipping lines abandoned the lower Red Sea early in the conflict, (76) an even higher proportion of the remaining Red Sea transits was presumably (in the author\\'s view) made up by these smaller, costconscious, and risk-acceptant shippers willing to risk the journey. These same shippers have often, in the past, brought Russian oil to Israel, and are therefore perfectly valid targets from a Houthi perspective. \\n\\nJMIC statistics suggest that 14 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, were targeted because outdated ownership data triggered the extant Houthi targeting criteria. (78) In some cases vessels carrying Russian oil, notably Andromeda Star, have also been misidentified with consulted outdated materials as British-owned and attacked.  \\n\\nCan the Houthis Maintain a Target Lock?\\n\\nIf one problem is incorrect characterization of whether a ship meets the targeting criteria, a parallel problem is whether the Houthis have a sufficiently good ability to differentiate and track targets during an attack. If they do not, then it is very possible (in the author\\'s view) that they may undertake attacks on a certain ship but end up striking a different one. Quite a lot of evidence supports this theory. First, JMIC statistics suggest that as high as 37 percent of ships attacked by the Houthis from November 19, 2023, to August 31, 2024, did not meet the Houthis\\' own extant targeting criteria. (79) Second, the Houthis have struck Iranian ships (ac) and vessels that had recently left Houthi ports, (ad) or which were visiting Houthi ports, (ae) all categories of vessel that would presumably have a lower risk of being intentionally targeted.\\n\\nThird, the Houthis have frequently appeared confused about which ships they struck: (af) for instance, claiming hits on multiple ships on July 11, 2024, with no apparent knowledge of the presence of the only actual ship struck (the Russian oil-bearing Rostrom Stoic), or the unwitting Houthi targeting of a Saudi tanker, Amjad, on September 2, 2024, which the Houthis mistook for the Russian oil-bearing Blue Lagoon 1. (80) Fourth, the Houthis have sometimes claimed to hit ships that are not physically present in the targeted waterway: For instance, the May 7, 2024, claim to have targeted the MSC Michela in the Red Sea when the ship (and indeed all MSC vessels) are no longer using the Red Sea, and the Michela was instead in the Atlantic Ocean. \\n\\nTo understand how the Houthis \"find, fix and finish\" (ag) a ship, once they think they have identified a legitimate target, it is important to look at the sensors available to them. Wide-area surveillance giving a \\'common operational picture\\' of what vessels are visiting the Red Sea is mostly provided by ship-based transponders, the Automatic Identification System (AIS). (82) This system--available in simple form via non-subscription websites and in fuller form via subscription services--accurately maps all vessels in a maritime space with a velocity vector (indicating speed and heading), ship name, classification, call sign, registration numbers, and other information. (83) To reduce the risk of AIS being used to predict the location of a vessel (say, in the three to five minutes flight time of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) at 300 kilometers distance), (84) the UK Maritime Trade Organization advised from June 13 onward that vessels weigh the navigational and collision risks of turning their AIS off in high-threats areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and consider turning their AIS off when under attack and altering course in order to prevent their targeting by dead reckoning (i.e., projecting their future location due to their bearing and speed). \\n\\nAIS is likely not the only source of targeting information used by the Houthis, not least as the JMIC data shows that 13 percent of attacks have successfully struck a ship even when AIS was turned off. There are indications that long-range electronic intelligence (ELINT) is used by the Houthis to track ships, even those with their AIS transponders switched off. For example, JMIC guidance stresses the need to reduce \"non-essential emissions: other than AIS such as \\'intraship UHF/VHF transmissions.\\'\" (86) U.S. and U.K. naval officers privately confirm that the Houthis do listen in to bridge-to-bridge communications. (87) The United States and the United Kingdom seem to have tried to reduce Houthi ELINT capabilities: As noted in the April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, (88) the United States undertook multiple sequences of airstrikes in 2023 and 2024 on retransmission towers and GSM cell towers on high ground overlooking the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. (89) Cellphone emissions close to shore may also be vulnerable to direction-finding, (90) not least because the Houthis control the key Yemeni telecommunications service providers, who are based in Sanaa. (91) It is also possible the Houthis have found ways to subscribe to commercial services that can triangulate terrestrial radio and combine it with AIS tracking. The Houthis are known to have received so-called Virtual Radar Receivers from Iran (92) that can create a targeting solution for aerial targets by fusing together open-source transponder and radio detection services. (93, ah) In the author\\'s view, the Houthis have probably already (with Iranian help) developed similar systems to combine vessel monitoring and radio direction-finding data.\\n\\nIn a final addition to this sensor network, the Houthis also probably utilize close-in sensors, such as surveillance UAVs, ship-borne AIS and radio monitoring, and visual scanning from boats. (94) At the outset of the conflict, the Houthis appear to have received radar and electronic intelligence steers from Iranian vessels (95) (such as Iranian frigates purportedly undertaking counter-piracy patrols, (ai) or various Iranian spy ships before they left the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden by mid-April 2024).  \\n\\nBy achieving closer shadowing of target vessels (see \"Tactical Evolution\" below), the Houthis appear to be reducing the timein-flight limitation of their long-range strike systems (which can exceed 100 minutes for a drone flying 300 kilometers, during which time a ship can move by as much as 75 kilometers). (98) Houthi missiles and drones may carry terminal guidance systems--certainly semi-active radar homing for anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), (99) also electro-optical cameras in UAVs, (100) and possibly (though this is unconfirmed) some form of guidance system in some ASBMs as well. (101) The combination of wide-area surveillance, close-in target shadowing, and terminal guidance has allowed the Houthis to achieve some impressive feats of marksmanship, such as an apparent near-miss on a U.S. aircraft carrier (ak) and a number of hits or very close misses by ASBMs on ships approximately 150-200 kilometers from launch points. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe prior April 2024 CTC Sentinel study on the Houthi war effort in October 2023 to April 2024 provided an in-depth review of Houthi anti-shipping weapons--the Mohit and Asef ASBMs, the Al-Mandab-2 anti-ship cruise missile, a variety of fixed and delta-wing explosive-carrying UAVs, plus explosive drone boats (unmanned surface vehicles, or USVs). (102) This study will not repeat the lengthy profiles of these weapons and how they have been employed by the Houthis, only insofar as their mode of employment has changed significantly since then. The April 2024 study anticipated a gradual depletion of higher-end systems like ASBMs, but this did not manifest. (103) The following chart (Figure 2) shows numbers of projectiles detected by the author as having been employed by the Houthis in anti-shipping attacks since the end of April 2024. (104) Like all attack data, this is an imprecise art and is only meant to be indicative of the number of missiles, (am) UAVs, and USVs reported by coalition forces as intercepted during attacks, or reported by shippers impacting near or on vessels in proven attacks. Trends include the rise in attacks by explosive drone boats (USVs) in the summer; a more even spread of attack types; and a consistent drumbeat of UAV attacks, probably reflecting the relative ease of producing such systems inside Yemen. \\n\\nIn qualitative terms, the main change in Houthi anti-shipping attacks was the continual refinement of tactics regarding the combination of weapons systems. Three stages of development can be observed; in each case, the tactics were first applied in the Red Sea and then were extended to the Gulf of Aden. (106) The stages overlap and are not exclusive--in many cases, the Houthis mixed and matched older and newer tactics--but they do seem to have unfolded as a progression to more complex operations. \\n\\n After a brief period of failing to replicate the seizure of the Galaxy Leader, the Houthis commenced stand-off attacks in December 2023 to late May 2024, largely using either UAVs or ASBMs or cruise missiles but not a mix. (108) Accurate ASBM shots became regular in the Red Sea toward the end of June 2024 and continued through mid-July.  \\n\\n The Houthis appear to have begun mixing UAVs and ASBMs or other missiles in series of attacks on single vessels in the Red Sea from the end of May and into early June.  \\n\\nAll-systems, close-up, and stand-off. The third stage of development also overlapped the first two, manifesting first in the Red Sea, and was characterized by much greater involvement of Houthi small boat flotillas, typically including at least one USV. (109) These \\'hunter-killer\\' packs first targeted the bulk carrier Tutor in the Red Sea on June 12, causing the vessel to sink on June 18, only the second ship to be sunk (at the time of publication) by the Houthis. (110) The Tutor attack was notable for a successful \"tail-chase\" by at least one explosive drone boat that crippled the vessel, (111 as) followed by subsequent attacks on the stranded and abandoned vessel that may have included UAVs, ASBMs, and possibly demolition charges placed by Houthis on small boats.   (112) While evacuating the crew, a coalition naval vessel destroyed another nearby USV. Days later, while adrift and unguarded, the Sounion was boarded by Houthi commandos who set barrels of explosive on the deck and detonated them in a vivid videoed propaganda attack that demonstrated almost complete Houthi freedom of action. \\n\\nAs the author\\'s April 2024 CTC Sentinel article noted, the Houthis were extensively drilling their fast attack boat and USV flotilla between early August 2023 and the outset of the Gaza war in October, (114) probably related to rising U.S.-Iran naval tensions in the Arabian Gulf, where Iran had made six attacks on Israeli or U.S.-linked vessels between February and July 2023.  (115) Houthi naval commander Brigadier General Mansour al-Saadi had boasted in mid-December that around 80 such USVs had been stockpiled, (116) and this author\\'s April 2024 report noted that very few of these had been used at that time, but many have been subsequently employed in June-August 2024. (117) The Houthi flotilla utilizes fishing boats, islands, and even foreign coastlines (in Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia) as sustainment hubs, (118) exploiting restrictive coalition rules of engagement to merge within civilian traffic. (119) The Houthi flotilla has employed tactical drones, electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, and AIS trackers to shadow and report on target ships, (120) with periodic reports of them approaching or hailing vessels to confirm their identity. (121) Houthi flotilla are very rarely attacked and do not appear to suffer communication problems with the mainland. (122) This would seem (in the author\\'s view) to be from the Houthi perspective an ideal combination of forward observation and close-in attack options, backed-up by long-range strike capabilities that can now be assured of updated information on ship locations.\\n\\n\\n\\n For U.S., U.K., and E.U. naval forces, these operations arguably (in the view of the author) represent the most intense maritime trial-by-fire since conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Falklands.   (126)) The Houthis (and the broader Axis of Resistance) might achieve a significant propaganda boon if a U.S. vessel were badly damaged or sunk, and even the withdrawal of a U.S. carrier battle group from the Red Sea was loudly trumpeted by the Houthis as a victory. In the sphere of air defense, the Houthis have not come close to threatening U.S.-manned aircraft, but they have taken a heavy toll on the U.S. drone fleet, destroying at least nine MQ-9 Reapers between November 8, 2023, and October 1, 2024. \\n\\nThe United States and partner forces in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have clearly reduced the damage that the Houthis could do to global shipping, as evidenced by an assessed 62 percent interception rate shown in Figure 1 of this study. In addition to interception of launched attacks, the U.S.-U.K. air campaign over Yemen has undoubtedly limited Houthi capabilities to find and fix commercial ships--for instance, a determined effort to blind the Houthi targeting system with intensified strikes on Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) in June 2024. \\n\\nHowever, the reduction of U.S. naval presence in the Red Sea, particularly the withdrawal of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in late June, has arguably opened up the space needed for the Houthis to redeploy their small boat flotillas and recommence more effective wolf pack tactics. (127) Of note, naval assets do not appear to have been sufficient to guard the Tutor and the Sounion after they lost power and were abandoned, (128) allowing the Houthis to access these stricken ships. Houthi attack patterns in June and July appeared to show greater freedom of movement for their small boat and USV flotillas and an enhanced ability to follow and repeatedly attack ships. (129) In sum, in the view of the author, freedom of safe navigation has clearly not been restored by the efforts of international navies, respectable shippers have not been assured, and Houthi attacks are not deterred.\\n\\nEqually concerning, one of the greatest exploitable weaknesses of the Houthis--significant reliance on a maritime line of supply to Iran, for military resupply and for financing--has not been addressed by the international naval presence in the Red Sea. Whatever military supplies cannot be made entirely locally in Yemen--notably missile guidance, engines, fuel, warheads, and C4ISR systems (130)--has to be squeezed through the Houthi Red Sea ports or smuggled overland through enemy territory controlled by Yemen\\'s internationally recognized government. Yet, the policing of the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the Houthis seems to have slackened during the current conflict, not tightened, in the author\\'s view. At least six large ships have visited the Houthi-held port of Hodeida in 2024 without stopping for inspection, as required by a U.N. Security Council resolution, at the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) hub at Djibouti. (131) This is unusual behavior that only started in the spring of 2024 when the war was underway.  (132) Alongside the risk of large ship transfers, which are legally difficult to interdict as they require flag-state permission to board, (133) there have also been a trickle of large dhows and fishing boats entering the Houthi-held inlets south and north of Hodeida (which were detailed in the April 2024 article), (134) with around 12 ships subsequently docking there in May-August 2024, according to the author\\'s local contacts. (135) On June 26-27, 2024, the Houthis also managed to overcome the aerial embargo by diverting a Yemenia flight to Amman so that it instead landed in Beirut, Lebanon, and returned from there to Sanaa, Yemen. (136) What all this points to is the likelihood that the Houthis have been able to sustain their operational tempo--despite increased expenditure of munitions and U.S.-U.K. strikes--because they are being resupplied at an adequate rate.\\n\\nUpdating the SWOT Analysis of the Houthi War Effort The April 2024 CTC Sentinel study issued an assessment of the demonstrated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing the Houthis in the first period of their war against Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, and global shipping. As the war turns one year old, the picture is arguably even bleaker for the forces trying to contain the Houthi threat.\\n\\nThe strengths shown by the Houthis are abundant and have been reinforced by events: Their pain tolerance was illustrated by their apparent insensitivity to having at least a third of their oil storage facilities destroyed by Israel on July 20, which they answered immediately by firing a ballistic missile at Israel and vowing to double their efforts to strike the Israeli state. The strategic depth of Yemen--its size and mountainous terrain--had complicated the task of finding and destroying Houthi missile and drone systems.  \\n\\nSome weaknesses identified in April 2024 appear to have been partially addressed by the Houthis. One senior U.S. naval officer with responsibility for the Yemen theater told the author in mid-2024, \"We came to see that the Houthis are not a ragtag force: they are resourced, trained, funded, stocked, supplied, and resupplied.\" (139) As noted, the Houthi line of supply to Iran has probably strengthened, with no apparent cost for bypassing a U.N. inspection regime. (140) As outlined above, Houthi air defenses are gradually strengthening, albeit only against drones, and the technical weakness of long-range target acquisition and tracking are arguably being mitigated with new wolf pack flotilla tactics. As one U.K. naval officer with experience of the Red Sea operations told the author: \"Iran has excellent marine traffic intelligence; the Houthis don\\'t.\" (141) Yet, there is some evidence to suggest that the Houthis have learned how to offset this weakness and track intended targets. (142) As this author noted previously, the Houthis could not operate in proximity to strong Western naval forces in the Red Sea, but the thinning out of these forces offsets the Houthi weakness in tactical proficiency. The economic weakness of the Houthi regime was briefly exploited by the Yemeni government before being abruptly turned off by Yemen\\'s backers--Saudi Arabia, the United Nations, and the United States.\\n\\nMajor opportunities now beckon for the Houthis and the \\'Axis of Resistance,\\' with the Houthis arguably having delivered the best military performance of all the axis players in the current war, in the author\\'s view. There is strong potential for the Houthis to build on their successes in severely constricting one of the world\\'s busiest global chokepoints, the Bab el-Mandab. International shippers, insurers, and governments must be careful to ensure the Houthis do not learn how to effectively monetize their ability to shut the Bab el-Mandab and Suez Canal to selected nations or shipping companies, which can be levered into a lucrative extortion racket. (143) As Houthi targeting capability gets more selective, this terrorist threat finance risk may rise, unless it is actively monitored and deterred through sanctions enforcement.  \\n\\nThe Houthis\\' elevation to a top-tier member of the \\'Axis of Resistance\\' presents other opportunities to the whole Iran-led bloc. Under the Houthis, Yemen has become a place from which the Iran threat network can undertake attacks on Israel that Iran itself does not dare to mount--already including ballistic missile and drone attacks on Tel Aviv. (144) Yemen might also be used by the axis as a way to mount attacks on other targets--such as U.S. forces--in a way that may not draw retaliation on more pain-sensitive parts of the axis--for instance, Iran. At present, the Houthis have used the boogey-man reputation of hypersonic weapons as an attentiongrabber, but in the future, Yemen could be an ideal site for such weapons considering its geographic placement and its proven ability to conceal launch sites in its rugged interior.\\n\\nLikewise, the expansion of Houthi presence into areas like Iraq--where a senior Houthi missileer was killed by a U.S. strike on June 30, 2024--could put Houthi strike capabilities in new areas such as Saudi Arabia\\'s northern border, (bi) the Iraq-Jordanian border, (bj) and Syria. (145) Where Iran and its local partners can sometimes be fearful of the consequences of striking foes such as Israel or the United States, the Houthis may be more willing. This is particularly the case as key Iranian partners like Hamas and increasingly Hezbollah face severe military pressure from Israel. It is intriguing that a more visible Houthi presence in Iraq (146) seemed to coincide with the first use by Iraqi groups (under the IRI umbrella) of what the Houthis call the Quds-type land attack cruise missiles (LACM), known in Iran as the 351/Paveh. \\n\\nThe Houthi attacks in the southern Gulf of Aden--south of Socotra and toward Djibouti--hint at what expeditionary Houthi boat flotillas might accomplish one day, off the African littoral and even operating on the eastern coast of Africa in weak state environments like Sudan, al-Shabaab enclaves, and Somalia.  Imagine what a more effective capability could do, in the manner of the German merchant raiders that haunted the Indian Ocean in both world wars. (147) Addressing this threat more effectively will very likely be a priority issue for U.S. policymakers in the future, and one that the intelligence community will be called upon to support with analysis.\\n\\nThe Houthis could also view Russian military support as an opportunity. In a recent on-the-record address in Washington, D.C., the U.S. envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, was explicit about the risks of Russo-Houthi partnership, noting: \"Their relationship with Russia is extremely troubling... Russia is irritated by our strong policy on Ukraine, and they are seeking other outlets to retaliate, including in Yemen. They have been seeking to arm the Houthis, which would be a game-changer.\" (148) Lenderking was reflecting widespread press reporting of a potential Iran-brokered Russian supply of Yakhont/P-800 Onik anti-ship cruise missiles to the Houthis, which U.S. comments were probably intended to dissuade. \\n\\nPerhaps the only sharp threat facing the Houthis is the possibility that the Axis of Resistance writ large could suffer a crippling number of defeats in the current war--in Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere--and that Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah support to the Houthis might not be as available in the future as it has been in the past. For instance, Hassan Nasrallah\\'s death (150) removes one of the most ardent supporters in Lebanon of the Houthi cause, potentially disrupting a key relationship and potentially focusing Hezbollah on its own internal problems. Indeed, one wonders if the abundant manpower of the Houthis could provide a source of outsider regime security forces willing to crack down on local populations where Iran-backed groups are feeling pressure--such as Lebanon, Syria, and even Iraq or Iran. \\n\\nThis underlines the unusual potential finding that Iran itself may be more vulnerable than the Houthis. As U.S. Central Command\\'s General Erik Kurilla told Congress on March 7, 2024, the key to suppressing Iranian partner forces like the Houthis may come in the form of pressuring Iran itself to force the axis to back down (151)--a kind of inside-out approach in which Iran uses its soft power, its ideological leadership role within the axis, to convince a Houthi ceasefire (probably temporary) in the shipping lanes. If this turns out to be true, this would suggest that it may be easier to try to threaten \"the head of the octopus\" (152) (Iran) than to try to directly coerce its newest and most resilient and aggressive tentacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010), p. 189.\\n\\n(2) For a recent explainer on the axis, see Kian Sharifi, \"Iran\\'s \\'Axis Of Resistance\\': Different Groups, Same Goals,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, February 19, 2024.\\n\\n(3) Author\\'s geolocated incident dataset of the post-October 7 war.

Bennett is quoted as saying: \"The head of the octopus is much weaker, much more vulnerable and feeble, than its arms. So how foolish are we to engage in war with the arms when we could engage with the head?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Salmoni, Loidolt, and Wells note that the Houthis are known by a variety of names: \"the \\'Houthis\\' (al-Houthiyin), the \\'Houthi movement\\' (al-Haraka al-Houthiya), Houthist elements\\' (al-\\'anasir al-Houthiya), \\'Houthi supporters\\' (Ansar al-Houthi), or \\'Believing Youth Elements\\' (\\'Anasir al-Shabab al-Mu\\'min).\"\\n\\n(b) On January 19, 2021, the outgoing Trump administration designated the Houthi organizational institution Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), a step that the Biden administration almost immediately revoked on February 16, 2021. Since then, some Houthi leaders remained covered by older sanctions (and additional Houthi military leaders continue to be added to U.S. sanctions lists) for posing a \"threat to the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" Then on January 17, 2024, the Biden administration redesignated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity but not as an FTO, a difference that enables easier access for humanitarian organizations and peace negotiators when the designation went into effect on February 17, 2024. For the newest SDGT designation, see \"Terrorist Designation of the Houthis: Press Statement by Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State,\" U.S. Department of State, January 17, 2024. For the prior sanctions, see \"Revocation of the Terrorist Designations of Ansarallah,\" U.S. Department of State, February 12, 2021. The U.S. government noted: \"Ansarallah leaders Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim remain sanctioned under E.O. 13611 related to acts that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.\" \\n\\n(c) One might look at the Israel July 20 attack on Houthi port facilities or the January 17, 2024, designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity as setbacks, but neither effort changed the Houthi behavior and the Houthis appear to have lost no senior leaders and no terrain since the war began, nor have they been notably economically damaged and the Houthi currency remains more stable than that of the internationally recognized government of Yemen. See \"The Economy,\" Yemen Review, April-June 2024.\\n\\n(d) There were two short pauses in Houthi anti-shipping attacks in 2024--April 9-24 and August 15-20--that are unexplained, though it is notable that these pauses coincided closely with periods of intense rain and flooding in Yemen, which tends to disrupt all military and non-military activities.\\n\\n(e) It is hard not to think of the movie boxer \"Rocky\" when looking at the fighting characteristics of the Houthis. Though this is charitable in the extreme--and does not reflect a sympathy for the Houthis--it is useful to view the Houthis in the Gaza war as an underdog boxer taking on much stronger opponents, whose aim may simply be to \"go the distance\" by supporting Hamas and the axis of resistance until the war ends (until the bell rings). Endurance and dogged pain aversion can be said to be characteristics of both the Houthis and the apocryphal Rocky Balboa.\\n\\n(f) This was the hope contained in this author\\'s assessment in his April 2024 CTC Sentinel article, which envisaged a triadic mechanism--increased usage and destruction of Houthi systems, compounded by tightened interdiction--slimming down Houthi arsenals.\\n\\n(g) The first phase, announced on November 14, 2023, called for attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea and on Israel proper. See Mohammed al-Harissi, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis vow to attack Israeli ships in Red Sea,\" National, November 14, 2023. The second phase, announced on December 9, 2023, declared Houthi intent to attack all ships headed to Israeli ports via the Red Sea. The third phase, announced after U.S./U.K. strikes on the Houthis on January 12, 2024, called for strikes on all U.S.- and U.K.-linked ships as well. Abdul Malik\\'s fourth phase was announced on May 3, 2024, broadened targeting to all ships whose owners or operators have visited Israeli ports. A fifth phase announced by Abdul Malik on July 21 was unclear in its expanded aims but seemed to focus more effort on Israel proper and its Mediterranean traffic and ports.\\n\\n(h) Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics suggest volume of shipping in the Red Sea dropped by 46 percent between November 2023 and February 2024, and has remained at these low levels since. Lloyd\\'s List traffic metrics similarly suggest Bab el-Mandab transits dropped by 57 percent in the same comparison and stayed at this lower level since February 2024. Maritime Spotlight data; Lloyd\\'s List Intelligence presentation, August 9, 2024, provided to the author.\\n\\n(i) This study lists a number of cases in which Houthi attack claims do not appear to have been correct, notably attacks on the Mediterranean shipping and Indian Ocean vessels.  All the maritime attack case studies in this article draw upon the very useful Washington Institute Maritime Spotlight online tracker by Noam Raydan and Farzin Nadimi.\\n\\n(j) In the author\\'s long study of the Houthi movement since the 2000s, a recurring feature is their keen eye for propaganda operations, about which the following listed authors dedicated entire chapters in their 2010 study. See Barak Salmoni, Bryce Loidolt, and Madeleine Wells, Regime and Periphery in Northern Yemen: The Houthi Phenomenon (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 2010).\\n\\n(k) Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) also reports the interception of incoming attacks that are not counted by JMIC incident reporting. JMIC incidents are reported by shippers, who are not themselves witness to interceptions far away from their vessels. To give an example of the OPG intercept data, on September 24, 2024, a tweet released by @CENTCOM noted that \"U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed one Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicle over the Red Sea.\" See U.S. Central Command, \"Sept 24 U.S. Central Command Update: In the past 24 hours, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed...,\" X, September 24, 2024.\\n\\n(l) If JMIC and thus Maritime Spotlight are reliant on self-reporting of attacks by shippers, it stands to reason that some attacks will be simply not detected (neither intercepted nor landing close enough to a vessel to be noticed) or simply not revealed for some reason (perhaps insurance-related).\\n\\n(m) The United Kingdom takes part in Poseidon Archer planned joint strikes with the United States in Yemen, but it does not appear to mount preemptive \\'dynamic\\' (opportunistic) strikes on launchers ashore, which are all undertaken by the United States.\\n\\n(n) It is hard to tell sometimes whether a reported strike on a \"missile launcher\" is a preemptive U.S. action (as a missile is readied for launch, arguably counting as an \\'attack\\') or a strike on a storage site that cannot be considered an attack by Houthi forces. In the data collation in this piece, all such marginal or inconclusive cases are not counted as an attack.\\n\\n(o) Interestingly, the chart does appear to show a rise in Houthi attacks after the end of the extended presence of the USS Eisenhower and supporting escort vessels in the Red Sea from November 4, 2023, to April 26, 2024. The Eisenhower returned to the Red Sea for a very intense period of Houthi attacks between May 6, 2024, and June 22, 2024, and there was no apparent downturn in attacks in that period. Since June 22, as later sections will detail (see \"Tactical Evolution\"), the Houthis seem to have exploited the reduction of U.S. presence. \\n\\n(p) On November 25, 2023, the Houthis claimed to strike an Israeli-linked container ship, CMA CGM Symi, in the Indian Ocean using a one-way attack drone, over 2,200 kilometers from the nearest Houthi-controlled area in Yemen. Considering the range, targeting support from Iran (in the form of the Safiz surveillance ship off the coast of India) is considered likely in this case. Details gathered from interviews with U.S. and U.K. military personnel for this study. \\n\\n(q) These include claimed attacks (all in 2024) on the Veracruz (April 24), MSC Vittoria 1 (May 7), MSC Alexandra (May 23), Aloraiq (June 1), and Anvil Point (July 1). \\n\\n(r) This includes all Houthi-claimed attacks launched either from Yemen or Iraq, which are likely to be comprehensive as the Houthis have a strong incentive to seek credit for such attacks. These Houthi-claimed attacks do not always result in confirmation of the attacks by Israel, particularly not when they are launched from Iraq. \\n\\n(s) The attack claims by IRI (including joint claims with the Houthis) often include videos of launches. The videos are not duplicated, being original each time, which is one indicator that attacks are genuinely being launched, but the lack of any supporting data means that it is still unclear whether all claimed attacks occur.\\n\\n(t) Very few Israeli press or government communiques give any insight into whether such IRI or IRI/Houthi-claimed projectiles reach Israel.\\n\\n(u) These are the claimed attacks on the Shorthorn Express (June 23), MSC Manazillo (June 26), Waler (June 28), the Ionnis (June 28), Lucky Sailor (July 1), and the Olvia (July 15). \\n\\n(v) These are the claimed attacks on the Destiny (May 15), the Essex (May 23), and the Minerva Antonia (May 29). The Essex, in particular, was quite far away from Israeli waters and docked at an Egyptian gas terminal at the time it was meant to be attacked near Israel. \\n\\n(w) The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) identified Houthi MRBMs used against Israel to be extended-range variant of the Houthi Burkan-3/Zulfiqar, known in Iran as Qiam/Rezvan. See the declassified dossier \"Iran: Enabling Houthi Attacks Across the Middle East,\" Defense Intelligence Agency, February 2024.\\n\\n(x) As many Chinese- and Russian-linked vessels have themselves visited Israeli ports in the past.\\n\\n(y) In the framework of great power competition, the Axis of Resistance clearly leans toward the non-U.S. bloc, led by China and Russia. In March 2023, Chinese and Russian diplomats reportedly sought Houthi guarantees that their shipping would not be hit in return for ongoing support to the Houthis in the UN Security Council. See Sam Dagher and Mohammed Hatem, \"Yemen\\'s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won\\'t Be Targeted,\" Bloomberg, March 21, 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n After the attack, Houthi spokesmen stated (incorrectly) that the vessel was attacked because it had British owners. \\n\\n After the attack, Houthi spokesmen stated (incorrectly) that the vessel was attacked because it had British owner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n See \"US Army Doctrine Reference Publication No. 3-05: Special Operations,\" U.S. Department of the Army, August 31, 2012, pp. \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n   The Houthis propagandized the carrier\\'s departure.

That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia. \\n \\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will. \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? \\n \\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. \\n \\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen. \\n \\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosives and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea. \\n \\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. \\n \\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit. \\n \\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope. And that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route. \\n \\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering. \\n \\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape. \\n \\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down. \\n \\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated $6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions. \\n \\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant. \\n \\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack. \\n \\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping have continued through the year. \\n \\n \\n \\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon). \\n \\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route. \\n \\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones. \\n \\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks. \\n \\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention. \\n \\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthis will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah. \\n \\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond. \\n \\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area. \\n \\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert. \\n \\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa. \\n \\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences. \\n \\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters. \\n \\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024. \\n \\nWritten by Terry Hutson for Africa Ports & Ships and republished with permission.

Picture courtesy Namport\\nPort of Lüderitz. \\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is Namibia’s second port and harbour, situated to the south of its big sister, Walvis Bay.\\n\\nFirst recorded by Europeans in 1487 when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias arrived on his epic voyage of discovery, Dias, in finding a sheltered harbour, gave it the name Angra Pequeña or ‘Little Bay’. This name persisted until 1883 when Heinrich Vogelsang, an agent of the German trader Adolf Lüderitz, bought the bay of Angra Pequeña together with the land within a radius of 8km from Chief Joseph Fredericks, the leader of the Bethanie Nama people. The bay was subsequently renamed in German, Lüderitzbucht, or plain Lüderitz in English, which is how we know it today.\\n\\nThe local economy boomed from 1907 after the discovery of diamonds 10 km southeast of Lüderitz. Today, over a hundred years later, the town is a fair sized settlement characterised by its distinctive German colonial buildings. The Port of Lüderitz was taken over by Namport from Trans Namib Harbours on 1 April 1995 with Namport having since invested in major developments of the harbour to handle larger vessels and more traffic.\\n\\nOther incentives to growth for the port and town came from the development of the Skorpion Zinc Mine in Rosh Pinah to the south-east of the port, and more recently by the export of manganese ore railed and road-hauled in from Northern Cape mines in South Africa. Another major development adding to the local economy has been the Lüderitz Waterfront, and the seasonal visits by cruise ships during the summer months.\\n\\nAnother view of the harbour at Lüderitz and the picturesque town beyond. \\n\\nSince 1995 investment has improved harbour facilities and Lüderitz now handles modern coastal traffic as well as the needs of the offshore sector, including the diamond mining and fishing industries.\\n\\nSeveral scheduled liner services are provided by shipping companies linking the Port of Lüderitz with the Ports of Cape Town and Walvis Bay, while other unscheduled shipping lines call on the port for specific loading and discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe port is situated 254 nautical miles south of the Port of Walvis Bay and 521 n.miles north of Cape Town. The town and port are linked by rail and road inland to Seeheim and Keetmanshoop respectively where they connect to the north towards the capital City, Windhoek and to the south-east with South Africa.\\n\\nThe Port of Lüderitz is able to offer excellent logistical services and links to other towns in Namibia and South Africa. It remains an important base for the fishing industry and the offshore diamond and mining industries, and for the shipping of the fruit industry’s exports to Europe, particularly grapes from Aussenkehr and from the Northern Cape Province.\\n\\nSituated on the Atlantic coast, Lüderitz makes it possible to save more than two days in delivery time to Europe and Northern America.\\n\\nThe port has a newish 500 metre long cargo and container quay with a depth alongside of -8.15 metres CD, two 60-tonne haulers and a 45-tonne reach stacker to provide efficient and safe cargo handling facilities for importers and exporters.\\n\\nAlthough the port has undergone dredging of its approaches and anchorage area to improve Lüderitz’s ability of handling bulk carriers, it offers few options for long-term development due to its depth constraint, For this reason, Namport carried out a study and identified that a new deep-water port in the adjacent bay in Lüderitz, in the vicinity of Angra Point, is feasible.\\n\\nLüderitz is served by three tug/work boats – the 32t bollard pull tug Onyeti, a 12.4t bollard pull work boat and a 9t bollard pull work boat. The port also has a harbour launch and three harbour lighters – two for cargo handling and one fitted for slops. Pilotage remains compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the time of writing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez is preparing to lead IMO’s delegation to the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November.\\n\\nThe 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will bring together world leaders along with an estimated 40,000 delegates representing governments, civil society and the private sector for discussions on how to address climate change.\\n\\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, the global maritime sector has committed to ambitious goals of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by or around 2050, as outlined in the 2023 IMO Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions from Ships.\\n\\nAt COP 29, Secretary-General Dominguez will share the latest developments in delivering the Strategy, including those related to ongoing negotiations towards a new set of binding economic and technical mid-term GHG reduction measures to decarbonise the maritime sector.\\n\\nCOP provides an opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with the energy and financial sectors as well as with cargo owners, given shipping’s vital role in the world’s energy transition and as the engine of global trade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of COP 29, IMO has made a submission to the 61st session of the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) outlining the progress made and actions taken to date to support maritime climate action.\\n\\nAmong other issues, the paper covers the outcomes achieved at the 82nd session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) held in September/October 2024.\\n\\nAt that meeting, the Committee advanced discussions on the proposed mid-term measures for GHG reduction, which include a global pricing mechanism for GHG emissions from ships and a global marine fuel standard.\\n\\nMember States identified areas of convergence and discussions resulted in a draft legal text – the IMO Net-Zero Framework – to be used as the basis for the next phase of talks.\\n\\nThe aim is to adopt these mid-term measures in late 2025, with a view to entry into force in 2027.\\n\\nThe submission will be presented to SBSTA 61 by the IMO Secretariat.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary-General Dominguez will attend various events and bilateral meetings during the first week of COP.\\n\\nIMO’s Climate and Clean Air Team will also participate in a number of maritime-related activities at COP 29 throughout the conference period.\\n\\nA side event co-organised by IMO, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (20 November, 1500 to 1630, Side Event Room 6) will focus on the theme: ‘Decarbonising Transport: Policies & Strategies For Aviation, Maritime and Land.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South African Lebombo border crossing with Mozambique near Komatipoort has been closed by South Africa following an outbreak of unrest and rioting at Ressano Garcia, on the the Mozambique side of the border.\\n\\nThis is the main border crossing leading to the port at Maputo, some 110km away and will be affecting South African exports of chrome, coal and other commodities.\\n\\nThe closure of the border followed reports of vehicles being set on fire on the road in Mozambique leading to the Maputo port.\\n\\nThe unrest, in which a growing number of deaths have occurred, with reports of at least 20 people shot dead and about 400 injured by Mozambique police, comes after dissatisfaction with the announced presidential election results, in which the ruling Frelimo party candidate swept into power with a claimed 70% of the vote.\\n\\nThe police are accused of using tear gas indiscriminately and shooting rubber bullets into the crowds of people gathering at various places to protest.\\n\\nAccording to reports from the country, security police are stationed along the roadside preventing people from entering Maputo city on foot. Tear gas has been used to control crowds from gathering.\\n\\nThe unrest is also reported from several other parts of the country, including in Niassa and Nampula provinces.\\n\\nThe unrest stems not only from unhappiness at the results of who supposedly won the election, but also at claims that widespread corruption from the highest political level is robbing ordinary citizens from enjoying the fruits of Mozambique’s natural wealth.\\n\\nReports say the country’s telecom operators have on instruction from government executed blackouts throughout Mozambique in an effort at controlling communication.\\n\\nBorder Management Authority officials, the South African police and the SA army have been engaged to stop the protests from spilling over into South Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGerman container carrier Hapag-Lloyd has gone on a spending spree for 24 new container ships.\\n\\nTwelve of the new vessels will have a 16,800-TEU capacity, with the balance a capacity of 9,200-TEU. They will be built at two Chinese shipyards.\\n\\nThe larger vessels will be built by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group and will be used to expand the capacity of existing services.\\n\\nThe 9,200-TEU ships have been ordered from New Times Shipbuilding Company Ltd and will replace older units in the Hapag-Lloyd fleet that will be nearing the end of their service life in this decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nDeliveries can be expected between 2027 and 2029.\\n\\nRepresenting an investment of roughly USD 4 billion, a long-term financing of USD three billion has already been committed.\\n\\nThe newbuildings will be equipped with state-of-the-art low emission high pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines that are extremely fuel-efficient. In addition, these vessels can be operated using biomethane, which can reduce CO2e emissions by up to 95% compared to conventional propulsion systems.\\n\\nThe new ships will also be ammonia-ready.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd’s chief executive, Rolf Habben Jansen said Hapag-Lloyd will continue to modernize and decarbonize the fleet.\\n\\n“This investment is one of the largest in the recent history of Hapag-Lloyd, and it represents a significant milestone for our company as it pursues the goals of its Strategy 2030, such as to grow while also modernizing and decarbonizing our fleet,” he said.\\n\\n“Operating a fleet of more efficient vessels will also enhance our competitive position, and thanks to the increase in capacity, we will continue to offer our customers a global, high-quality product.\\n\\nHapag-Lloyd controls 287 modern container ships with a total transport capacity of 2.2 million TEU, making the company one of the world’s leading liner shipping companies. In addition, it operates the largest fleet sailing under the German flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ which arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. Picture by ‘Dockrat’\\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not unknown for vessels to be repurposed by their owners, or to be purchased by new owners, who then have them rebuilt, overhauled, or refitted, to carry out a completely different function from that for which they were originally built. The types of vessel for which this can occur are many, and can cover every aspect of the maritime industry, from the complex and technical, to the non-complex and non-technical.\\n\\nExamples of such changes to existing vessel purposes are a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) tanker being repurposed to act as a Floating Storage Production and Offloading (FPSO) unit for the oil and gas industry. Or a Panamax gearless bulk carrier being repurposed to act as an offshore transshipment vessel (OTV), given offset loading cranes, or conveyor loaders, and used to transfer bulk ore from a nearby port, out to a Capesize bulk carrier anchored offshore.\\n\\nSometimes the changes to a vessel are not simply to utilise its core design, and purpose, and make the design changes to allow it to be used in a similar, but a more dynamic role, as with the FPSO or the OTV. There are examples, especially in those maritime industries which are well known for producing vessels for extremely complicated operations. Sometimes these vessels are repurposed, not once in their career, but twice, and with each change bearing no connection, or similarity, to that purpose from which they were repurposed.\\n\\nOn 20th October, at midday, the fibre optic cable laying vessel ‘CS Vega II’ arrived off Cape Town, from Gursken in Norway. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeding into the Duncan Dock, and went alongside the inner berth of the Eastern Mole. Such a berthing arrangement is indicative of a logistical call for bunkers, stores and provisions.\\n\\nCS Vega II. Cape Town, 20 October 2024. \\n\\nIn an unusual coincidence, it meant that two cable laying vessels were to be berthed back to back in the port, as the Cape Town based cable vessel, ‘Leon Thevenin’, was unloading cable at the outer berth of the Eastern Mole, having arrived back in the port on 18th October, after completing a submarine cable repair mission on the East coast to the north of Durban.\\n\\nBuilt in 2008, with her hull being built by Odys Stocznia Sp.z.o.o. at Gdansk in Poland, ‘CS Vega II’ was then towed to Norway where she was completed and outfitted by Fosen Mekaniske AS shipyard, at Rissa. She has a length of 80 metres and a gross registered tonnage of 5,117 tons. She is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by four Caterpillar 3516 TA generators providing 10,200 kW. Power is transferred to two Siemens 1RN4 HM90-Z motors which provide power to two Wärtsilä SP35CRP azimuth thrusters, giving her a service speed of 17 knots.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single Caterpillar C18 ACERT harbour generator providing 465 kW, and a single Volvo Penta D7A TRC emergency generator providing 115 kW. She has a water making system producing 15 tons of fresh water per day. For added manoeuvrability ‘CS Vega II’ has a single bow Brunvoll FU80 LTC2000 transverse thruster providing 800 kW, and a single bow Brunvoll AR63 LNC1650 retractable azimuth thruster providing 880 kW.\\n\\nHer twin stern azimuth thruster pods, and her twin bow thruster arrangement gives ‘CS Vega II’ a dynamic positioning classification of DP2, which is provided by a Kongsberg K-Pos DP21 system. The DP parameters are provided by three Anschütz gyro compasses, three DGPS systems, four Seatex MRU-5 motion reference units, one Seatex MRU-D motion reference unit, and one HiPAP 500 high precision acoustic positioning system.\\n\\nOne of two sisterships, ‘CS Vega II’ was built to a MT6007 design from the marine architect company, Marin Teknikk AS, of Gurskøy in Norway. The building costs of ‘CS Vega II’ were US$27.38 million (ZAR476.24 million), and she was launched as ‘Boa Thalassa’. She was a unique vessel as she was built as a seabed survey vessel, but not as a seismic survey vessel. She was the first ever seabed profiling vessel built to utilise electromagnetic surveying, rather than a seismic source. Accommodation was provided for 54 crew and survey personnel.\\n\\n  \\n\\nShe operated as a survey vessel until 2022, when her first transition took place. She was renamed ‘CF Explorer’ and converted into an offshore accommodation vessel, known as a Special Purpose Ship (SPS) ‘Walk to Work’ vessel, for use in the North Sea offshore wind farm construction industry. Converted in Holland, she received a walk to work covered gangway, her survey deck was stripped, and additional cabins were fitted in its place, which increased her accommodation to allow for 72 crew and construction workers.\\n\\nAfter a short 18 months in this role, she was sold on once more, to her present owners, who purchased her with a view to giving her a further conversion, this time to a fibre optic cable laying vessel. The conversion included the removal of her stern helideck, the reconfiguring of her stern with a cable laying sheave. The conversion was undertaken by Green Yard Kleven AS shipyard, at Ulsteinvik in Norway.\\n\\nCS Vega II as built, named Boa Thalassa. \\n\\nThe conversion was planned by Marin Tekknik AS, her original marine architects, and included the fitting of a new aft cable hangar housing Parkburn cable laying equipment, a new fibre optic cable carousel, two Parkburn knuckleboom deck cranes, and a stern mounted Hydramarine knuckleboom crane with a lifting capacity of 5 tons, for cable operations requirements.\\n\\nShe is now owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone World Engineering Corporation (NTT WE), of Yokohama in Japan. She is operated by NTT WE Marine, also of Yokohama, whose company name is emblazoned on her hull, and she is managed by TDG Ship Management, of Manila in the Philippines. Her owners have been in existence since 1952, as a telecommunications company, and moved into offshore cable laying operations in 1980.\\n\\nShe will be replacing another smaller cable vessel, ‘CS Vega’, built in 1984, and which has now reached 40 years of age, and is currently conducting cable operations in the Philippines. The NTT ME Marine company has conducted virtually all of its offshore cable laying operations within the waters of Japan, and its outlying islands, as well as more recently, further afield within greater Southeast Asia.\\n\\n \\n\\nFor the nomenclature aficionado, the name of ‘CS Vega II’ is simply broken down, with her name prefix of ‘CS’ referring to ‘Cable Ship’, and ‘Vega’ being the major star in the northern hemisphere constellation of Lyra. With her being the second such named vessel in the NTT WE Marine fleet, her name suffix is the Roman numeral ‘II’.\\n\\nAfter a short period of just 18 hours alongside in Cape Town, ‘CS Vega II’ had completed her uplift of bunkers, stores onload, and replenishment of fresh provisions, and was ready to sail. At 06:00 in the morning of 21st October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing that her destination was to be the port of Subic Bay in the Philippines.\\n\\nThe port of Subic Bay, is on the island of Luzon, located at 14°48’ North 160°17’ East, and lies 54 nautical miles to the northwest of Manila Bay. It was formerly the massive United States Navy base, which acted as a service base for the Pacific Seventh Fleet, and reached its peak during the period of the Vietnam War with over 200 ship visits per month.\\n\\nIn 1992 the United States military handed back all military facilities in the Philippines to the local government, and withdrew from the country. The Subic Bay port facilities were taken over as a Freeport, and massive infrastructure development began. Today, the port is a major container terminal, offering a total of 25 berths, and is now the site of a major shipyard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential Election is ‘a step in the wrong direction’ for international trade as importers fear another spike in ocean container shipping freight rates.\\n\\nTrump has vowed blanket tariffs of up to 20% on all imports into the US and additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on goods from China.\\n\\nData from Xeneta – the ocean and air freight intelligence platform – shows the last time Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese imports during the trade war in 2018, ocean container shipping freight rates spiked more than 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump Presidency is a step in the wrong direction,” said Peter Sand, Xeneta Chief Analyst.\\n\\n“The knee-jerk reaction from US shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs. Back in 2018, the tariff on Chinese imports was 25%, now it is increasing up to 100% so the incentive to frontload is even greater.\\n\\n“If you have warehouse space and the goods to ship, frontloading imports is the simplest way to manage this risk in the short term – but it will bring its own problems. A sudden increase in demand on major trade lanes into the US when ocean supply chains are already under pressure due to disruption in the Red Sea will place upward pressure on freight rates.\\n\\n“We saw the negative impact of tariffs during Trump’s first term in office in 2018 when ocean container shipping rates spiked 70%. Shippers will be fearing more of the same this time around.\\n\\n“In the longer term, another Trump presidency will reignite the trade war with China and provoke retaliatory action. In 2018, we saw China respond to US aggression by imposing tariffs of its own, which added even more fuel to the fire, so there is a risk this situation could escalate further in the months and years to come.”\\n\\nAverage spot rates from the Far East to US West Coast and US East Coast have remained relatively flat in the weeks leading up to the US Election, down -3.5% and -2.5% respectively since 15 October.\\n\\nHowever, the current average spot rates of USD 5,210 per FEU (40ft container) into the US West Coast and USD 5,820 per FEU into the US East Coast are 167% and 134% higher than 12 months ago, primarily due to the ongoing impact of conflict in the Red Sea.\\n\\nSand said that 2024 has been a brutal year for US shippers who have already endured massive disruption due to the Red Sea crisis and spiralling freight rates.\\n\\nThere is also the looming threat of further strike action at ports on the US East Coast and Gulf Coast in January next year, he said.\\n\\n“Another Trump presidency will not be welcomed by US importers and exporters, but they needed a swift and clear result in the election. Uncertainty is toxic for supply chains, so at least the industry now has a clearer understanding of the financial and operational risk and can execute the plans they will have prepared in the event of another Trump presidency.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the older harbour tugs, Inyalazi, seen on Durban Bay in May 2004. \\n\\n\\n\\nTransnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has published a Request for Information (RFI) for a strategic pilot project to use green and cleaner fuels for its selected diesel-operated tugboat fleet.\\n\\nThe project forms part of Transnet’s commitment to bolster South Africa’s transition to a low carbon-economy focused on cleaner, renewable and green fuels.\\n\\nThe RFI invites interested parties to submit proposals for the technical assessment on old diesel tugboats. The scope of work includes information regarding assessing the condition of the existing tugboats, evaluating components such as the diesel engines, and inspecting the mechanical and structural compartments for potential new components or modifications.\\n\\nThis initiative is a pilot project to retrofit existing tugboats to utilise alternative fuels including Liquefied Natural Gas, Biodiesel, Hydrogen and Methanol.\\n\\nBased on the success of the retrofitting pilot phase, the tugboats will be restored to optimal operational performance and efficiency, enabling them to service the ports with using improved fuel and sustainable environmental impact.\\n\\n“The plans to retrofit TNPA’s tugboat fleet with low-to-no carbon fuel is a significant step towards decarbonising shipping and reducing the carbon footprint of our marine craft,” said NPA Acting Chief Executive, Phyllis Difeto.\\n\\nShe said this project stems from TNPA’s energy mix initiatives, which respond to the Ports Authority’s objectives of operating an environmentally sustainable port system.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe RFI documents can be accessed on the Transnet tender portal by clicking here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Elizabeth, situated in Algoa Bay close to the vessels rounding the Cape of Good Hope. \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron Marine Lubricants has extended its global supply capacity to include South Africa’s Port Elizabeth. This expansion takes advantage of vessels taking the longer route to avoid the Red Sea conflict area.\\n\\nIt also represents a strategically important addition to Chevron’s distribution network in the southern region.\\n\\nAccording to Chevron, the expansion has been made possible through close collaboration with local partners, demonstrating the power of partnerships to enhance customer service and supply. By ensuring supply availability in Port Elizabeth, the overall supply reliability of Chevron’s range of marine lubricants is endorsed and improved.\\n\\n“This marks a significant milestone in the development of our distribution network in southern waters,” says Ayten Yavuz, Global Marine Lubricants General Manager at Chevron.\\n\\n“Port Elizabeth is a major port of call, and having Chevron lubricants available will certainly increase the service reliability for visiting vessels.” He added they have worked closely with their local partners to make this strategic expansion possible. “I wish to thank them for their excellent cooperation,” Yavuz said.\\n\\nThe current range of Chevron’s marine engine lubricants, including the popular Taro Ultra range, will be available to ships calling at Port Elizabeth. The port is operational 363 days a year. In addition to bulk and container handling, Port Elizabeth has a berth for liquid cargo operations (currently under repair).\\n\\nChevron describes the significance of the port as being that, prior to 2023, an average of 1050 visiting vessels called over a 36-month period. However, since October 2023, vehicle carrier passings have risen substantially, and many operators are currently routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez visited five countries in the Red Sea area from 28 October to 1 November. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn 4 November IMO reported that Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez had completed a series of visits to countries in the Red Sea area, to discuss the current situation and express support for freedom of navigation as well as concern for innocent seafarers, particularly those who remain captive with the MV Galaxy Leader.\\n\\nMr Dominguez said: ‘The continuous attacks on ships and seafarers in the Red Sea are endangering innocent human lives, affecting the entire shipping industry and therefore the global economy.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘International shipping carries around 80% of trade in goods in the world and the Red Sea is one of the main shipping routes. All countries are affected by disruptions to international shipping.\\n\\n‘The countries in the region have been greatly affected. Last week, I travelled to Djibouti, Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to discuss the situation with Government representatives and consider how IMO could further support them.\\n\\n‘I will continue to engage with all IMO Member States, UN agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the principle of freedom of navigation is re-established in the interests of all parties.\\n\\n‘These visits represent a message of support from the IMO to all those who work every day to maintain international shipping.\\n\\n‘It is through discussions with all the countries that we will be able to protect seafarers and build a resilient and sustainable maritime transport system. This region has a strategic role and great potential for development to enable maritime transport to become more sustainable.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPM Terminals, which operates the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the second busiest in Africa, has announced the appointment of Keld Mosgaard Christensen as Managing Director of SCCT.\\n\\nChristensen’s appointment was effective from 1 November 2024. He comes to SCCT directly from his position as Managing Director of the Port of Salalah, Oman.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior to his time in Oman, Christensen worked with APM Terminals in Poti, Georgia, and at APM Terminals headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands.\\n\\nWith a Masters in Law from the University of Aarhus, Christensen began his career with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rising to Consul General before transitioning to the corporate world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD Ports Group has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Somali Ministry of Fisheries & Blue Economy, aiming to explore joint investment and development opportunities in Somalia’s fisheries, ports, and maritime sectors.\\n\\nThe agreement seeks collaboration on various initiatives, including the integration of fish ports and processing plants, the development of a maritime monitoring centre, port infrastructure upgrades, the construction of integrated fishing ports, and the establishment of a technical vocational training school.\\n\\nLeveraging its extensive experience in managing ports, economic cities, and free zones, AD Ports Group will work with the Somali Ministry to develop these sectors and identify other potential projects.\\n\\nAD Ports Group’s involvement in Africa includes recent concessions in Egypt, the Republic of Congo, Angola, and Tanzania. The UAE, a long-time supporter of Somalia, sees agriculture comprising about two-thirds of the nation’s economic output. The World Bank forecasts a 3.7% growth in the Somali economy this year, expected to rise to 4.5% in 2025.\\n\\nSomalia’s Minister of Fisheries & Blue Economy, Ahmed Hassan Aden, highlighted the significance of this partnership, stating, “By joining forces with AD Ports Group, we are laying the groundwork for long-term growth and sustainability in our port infrastructure and fishing industries. This collaboration will enhance our capacity, drive economic development, and provide new opportunities for our communities.”\\n\\nCaptain Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, Managing Director & Group CEO of AD Ports Group, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing their commitment to supporting Somalia’s economic growth through potential investments and collaborations in the nation’s maritime and fisheries sectors. He noted the Federal Ministry’s aim to unlock the sector’s potential by leveraging AD Ports Group’s global expertise and resources.\\n\\nThe MoU will also explore cooperation on maritime regulations enforcement, technology and infrastructure development, and the provision of project management and other mutually beneficial opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Mombasa. \\n\\n\\n\\nKenya’s Port of Mombasa has received a nod of approval from customers across seven East African states, according to a recent customer satisfaction survey undertaken by a Nairobi research firm, SBO Training Ltd.\\n\\nThe independent study involving over 1,200 port users who have experience of the Kenyan port, revealed a 79% satisfaction rate, up from 70% expressed at a previous survey held in 2020.\\n\\nA majority of those consulted for the study said they had noticed changes and improvements during the past year, in particular changes involving the use of modern technology. This, they said, resulted in improvements in service delivery and trust in the port authority.\\n\\nSpecial note was made of Kargo Pay, a 24/7 payment system recently introduced, which offers flexibility and convenience for users and allowing payment to be made remotely.\\n\\nThe survey included details of the increase in container traffic at the Mombasa port, which has reached 1.8 million TEU. At the previous survey this number was 1.4 million TEU.\\n\\nIt also reported that Uganda’s cargo throughout at the port of Mombasa stood at just over seven million tonnes for 2023.\\n\\nOf this 6.2 million tonnes were imports, while 829,400 tonnes of exports were registered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe container ship Maersk Kowloon, at anchor in the Egyptian Great Bitter Lakes. \\n\\n\\n\\nYemen’s Houthi militia claimed responsibility for attacks on three ships in adjacent international waters, re-intensifying their maritime campaign in the region.\\n\\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree announced that the militia had targeted the SC Montreal, Maersk Kowloon, and Motaro, citing their parent companies’ violations of a ban on sailing to Israeli ports as justification for the assaults.\\n\\nDetails of the Attacks:\\n\\nThe 33,900-dwt SC Montreal (IMO 9311830), a Liberian-flagged container ship en route from Salalah, Oman to Pointe des Galets, Reunion, was attacked with two drones while sailing in the southern Arabian Sea. There are no additional details or independent confirmation of this attack.\\n\\nThe Maersk Kowloon (IMO 9290476), also Liberian-flagged, was reportedly targeted by a cruise missile in the Arabian Sea while sailing from Salalah in Oman. The 300m vessel, presumably unharmed, is currently off the South African coast and listing New York as her next destination and can be assumed unharmed.\\n\\nThese two attacks in the Arabian Sea occurred last Monday, 28 October 2024.\\n\\nThe 2006-built bulk carrier Motaro (IMO 9310290), another Liberian vessel traveling from Ust Luga in Russia to China, faced multiple ballistic missile strikes while in the Red Sea and approaching the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\\n\\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that the master of the Motaro, while navigating 25 nautical miles south of Yemen’s Mocha, noted three explosions nearby; however, the vessel and its crew remained unharmed and continued on its way.\\n\\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) identified the Motaro as having no direct connections to Israel, the US, or the UK but noted a subsidiary link to a vessel that had previously docked in Israel.\\n\\nSaree asserted that these attacks are part of the Houthis’ broader campaign to support Palestine and Lebanon amid ongoing regional tensions.\\n\\nThe continuing attacks on maritime shipping in this region pose significant risks to regional and international trade, while further complicating the geopolitical landscape amid ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn a related development, the Houthi spokesman claimed that drones had been launched at an industrial zone in Ashkelon, Israel, allegedly achieving their targets. Israeli media confirmed explosions in Ashkelon and Nahariya, attributing one of the drones to a launch from Lebanon.\\n\\nThe Israeli military confirmed that a UAV originating from Yemen had landed in an open area in Ashkelon.\\n\\nThese recent incidents come after previous Houthi drone and missile strikes against Israel, which provoked retaliatory airstrikes from Israeli forces targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Hodeidah, particularly in July and September.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA needs assessment mission carried out in Guinea will assist the Member State in the preparatory stages of setting up a maritime single window system in the Port of Conakry. This was reported by the IMO news service on 29 October.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Maritime Single Window (MSW) is a one-stop digital platform designed to streamline communication among different stakeholders and agencies involved in clearing the arrival, stay and departure of ships. By consolidating information exchange into a single interface, the system is expected to significantly reduce time and costs associated with port procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince 1 January this year it has been mandatory for all IMO Member States, which are contracting parties to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), to establish maritime single window systems in ports to enhance the efficiency of shipping worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needs assessment mission took place from 21 to 25 October, conducted by IMO consultants in collaboration with the Port of Conakry, relevant Ministries, public agencies including customs and border agencies, and other involved stakeholders. The last day of the mission allowed discussions between the consultants and all stakeholders to validate the findings.\\n\\n\\n\\nA comprehensive mission report will lay the groundwork for further actions in the development of the maritime single window in Guinea. This includes findings and analyses carried out to identify weaknesses and gaps with respect to legislation, organization, IT systems, procedures and personnel for the deployment of a maritime single window, according to IMO principles and guidance, including related IT tools which interact with the maritime single window.\\n\\nThe report will provide recommendations for an efficient and successful implementation of the MSW in Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis activity is delivered through IMO’s Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme (ITCP) with the collaboration of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine of Guinea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort of Beira, disrupted by political unrest. \\n\\n\\n\\nDemonstrations in favour of the political candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, have brought disruptions to the smooth working at the port of Beira.\\n\\nThe political demonstrations have affected the regular flow of road trucks arriving at the Beira port from neighbouring countries, mainly Zimbabwe and Zambia.\\n\\nLocal reports say that Cornelder de Moçambique, which operates the Beira port, usually handles about 700 trucks a day but when demonstrations take place this number drops by half.\\n\\nOnce the demonstrations are over the number of trucks arriving outside the port increases, on occasion to as many as 2,000 vehicles in a day with at times up to 80 trucks per hour arriving at the port.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has become a concern for Cornelder, the reports say. Jan de Vries, managing director of Cornelder de Moçambique was quoted as confirming that on the days when the demonstrations are being held, the number of trucks generally decreases.\\n\\nHe said the reduction in flow of trucks was worrying. Beira, as Mozambique’s second busiest port, is a key driver in the country’s economy and is an important gateway for countries in the region.\\n\\nAlthough unable to quantify the problems this is causing, the arriving ships are impacted as a result of slower working rates due to sudden non-availability of cargo, with vessel working on occasion brought to a standstill.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that with the demonstrations it was difficult to measure the real impact on the one-way road, “because we have very quiet days,” he was quoted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following weather warning covering the Port of Durban has been received for the period:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSW winds are expected to reach an average speed of 25 to 29KT from Monday afternoon and are expected to gust 35 to 40KT on Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours that might lead to flooding are expected on Monday afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGulf of Aden and southern Red Sea. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is winning the battle for the Red Sea? If I were taking bets right now, I’d have some of my money on the Houthis, for they seem to be retaining the initiative. That’s based on current results, and one cannot really imagine they will be able to continue preventing over 60 per cent of all shipping from using the waterway dividing Africa from Asia.\\n\\nThis month it is one year since the first drone or missile was fired at a merchant ship sailing innocently through the now infamous Bab al-Mandab Strait. That’s the narrow point at the lower end of the Red Sea after which it becomes the Gulf of Aden. This is conveniently close to the Yemen coast from where the Houthis are able to fire off Iranian-supplied missiles and drones almost at will.\\n\\nWho are these Houthis?\\n\\nWho are these Houthis? The Houthi movement is a Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organisation enjoying the backing of Iran, which by force of arms has wrested control over a large part of Yemen, including the capital of Sanaa and most of the coast facing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\\n\\nIn recent years the Houthi movement successfully held off attempts of overthrowing it by the combined military forces of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Despite the Houthis having occupancy of the capital and control over much of the economically productive regions, the movement lacks international recognition and the government it overturned remains, at least on paper, the recognised legal authority of Yemen.\\n\\nAmong the weapons used against merchant shipping are waterborne drones – smallish semi-submerged motorised vessels loaded with high explosive and used to target ships sailing even some distance from the Yemen coast. Such craft have been used in the Black Sea with devastating effect by the Ukrainians, effectively chasing what remains of the Russian Black Sea fleet to the far corners of that enclosed sea.\\n\\nOff the Yemeni coast over a hundred ship attacks have been recorded in the past 12 months, with two vessels sunk and four seafarers killed. Some of the vessels were set on fire. Another two were highjacked and taken to Yemeni anchorages with their crews detained on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe result of this year-long naval activity, ostensibly targeting ships with an Israeli interest although making no guarantee that other shipping remains safe, is that the majority of vessels that ordinarily would travel via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have been forced to sail the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nThat requires another ten to 14 days of sailing time, with commensurate added expense, for which someone has to pay! At a guess it isn’t the shipping companies, who as in the days of the Covid-19 pandemic, are suddenly anticipating strong and rewarding year-end results. Increased tariffs are once again bearing surprising fruit.\\n\\nAs just one example, Maersk is reporting a 41% increase in revenue and that’s in spite of having to re-route all of its Asia-Europe-Asia ships south via the Cape of Good Hope.\\n\\nAnd that means increased bunker consumption and overall operating costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBetween 10 and 12 per cent of total global trade by volume goes – or went – through the Suez Canal, which automatically includes the Red Sea. By way of interest, 22 per cent of the canal traffic is made up of container ships. Car carriers also number around the 20 per cent mark while oil products including crude oil vessels account for another 25 per cent. That’s around two thirds of the total shipping that would ordinarily use the shorter route.\\n\\nMost of those vessels are now avoiding the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is suffering.\\n\\nIt’s important to highlight containers, cars and oil products, because the ships that carry these commodities are among those that now lead the way in diverting around the Cape.\\n\\nThe big loser in all this is probably Egypt, the owner of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA), effectively the Egyptian Government, has seen revenue plummet and no solution in sight. Other ships are still using the canal, which is physically unaffected, but the numbers are seriously down.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian reports, the SCA has lost an estimated US$ 6 billion in revenue since the Red Sea crisis began. Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty revealed this last week following his meeting with the Secretary-General of International Maritime Organization (IMO), Arsenio Dominguez.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Houthis fired their first missiles and drones towards Israel in October 2023, US Navy ships played an early and decisive role in assisting Israeli defences. In addition, the US and its allies quickly formed a coalition of naval forces to provide a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to intercept missiles as they were fired from Yemeni positions.\\n\\nThe naval ships were soon heavily involved in assisting merchant ships that were being targeted by Houthis around the Bab al-Mandab Strait and later in the Gulf of Aden. Details of the size and identity of the naval forces haven’t always been forthcoming but at one stage it was quite significant.\\n\\nAircraft too came into the equation, involving missions over Houthi-held Yemeni territory which were aimed at reducing the Houthi’s ability to target passing ships or to target Israel. Though claiming to be successful, a number of ships risking the journey through the Red Sea or even those operating in the Gulf of Aden en route to nearby Djibouti, continue to come under Houthi attack.\\n\\nIn January this year President Joe Biden said the air and naval strikes against Houthi launch and storage facilities would continue to protect the free flow of international commerce. Regardless of this, the attacks on international shipping has continued through the year.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Houthis these attacks will continue until Israel abandons its invasion of Gaza (and that now includes Israel having to abandon raids into parts of southern Lebanon).\\n\\nThere are conflicting reports suggesting the interest of the international naval forces is starting to wane over what happens in southern Red Sea. While no such announcements or intentions have been made, it will only add to the concerns of those whose ships continue using the shorter route.\\n\\nOf course, it could be that any reduction of the naval forces may simply be in proportion to the decreasing number of ships running the gauntlet of missiles and drones.\\n\\nOn the other hand many see the ‘allied’ response as being defensive and not sufficiently offensive towards the Houthis as the latter continue firing off their missiles and directing their drones. That’s despite the US and UK air forces in the region having undertaken numerous raids across Yemen in an effort to degrade the Houthi ability of continuing their attacks.\\n\\nThe latter remains a difficult task. The Houthi’s don’t require sophisticated launch pads or airfields for their drones or even some missiles. They don’t require expensive or noticeable equipment or facilities to handle the launches. Supplies of missiles and drones can be easily stored or transported without drawing much attention.\\n\\nHow long will this go on before once again the Red Sea and Suez Canal can be considered safe shorter routes on the long journey between South-East Asia and Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America? It’s anybody’s guess at the moment. There no end in sight in Gaza, and no reason to think the Houthi’s will abandon their support for their compatriots in Hamas or Hezbollah.\\n\\nWill US and European nations continue providing naval cover for commercial shipping wanting to sail the length of the Red Sea? It seems maybe not. The EU’s mission Aspides commander indicated recently that Aspides lacks the ships and resources necessary to respond.\\n\\nWhich is surprising considering the extent to which most of those same European nations have continued their support of the EU NAVFOR naval forces guarding against piracy and smuggling in the wider Middle East area.\\n\\nShipping companies meanwhile have accepted that the diversion of their ships around the Cape will have to continue well into 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it’s not only merchant ships that are avoiding the gauntlet. A German Navy frigate, no less, has been instructed to divert.\\n\\nWhat was a surprise this past week concerns the German Navy frigate, FGS Baden-Württemberg (F222), returning from the far-off Pacific, which will not risk the crossing of the Red Sea and is instead taking the longer route around South Africa.\\n\\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius issued instructions for the frigate and the fleet auxiliary Frankfurt-am-Main to avoid the shorter and much cheaper route into the Mediterranean because the ship lacks suitable long-range defences.\\n\\nNor were there any suitable escorts to accompany the German ships through the dangerous waters.\\n\\nThis is the same ship that in September helped tweak the Chinese whiskers by sailing provocatively through the Taiwan Strait! Minister Pistorius was again the person to make that announcement on 14 September 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMein Schiff 4, the TUI luxury cruise ship was an unusual recent visitor at Cape Town, a welcome divert from the Red Sea route. \\n\\nPictures by ‘Dockrat’\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nEarlier in the week the dictionary word for the casual maritime observer to look up was ‘Leviathan’. Fast forward a few days, and the new word for the casual maritime observer to cast their eyes over in the dictionary is ‘Behemoth’.\\n\\nAgain, in a biblical sense it is a powerful animal, and one which will do battle with Leviathan. In the modern sense of the word, it is something of monstrous size, power, or appearance, or an entity. It can also be described as an entity, or an organisation, that is extremely large, and often extremely powerful.\\n\\nAnd so it was that yet another large cruise liner fetched up on South Africa shores. Once more the casual maritime observer can offer their perverse thanks to the idiotic Houthis for allowing them the honour of welcoming the next gargantuan cruise liner into a South African port. Had it not been for the risks associated with a Red Sea transit, this particular vessel was supposed to finish her last cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean, slip through the Suez Canal, head for the Persian Gulf and begin a full season of cruising based out of the region. Instead, a Cape sea route diversion beckoned.\\n\\nOn 28th October, at 07:00 in the morning, the passenger cruise liner ‘Mein Schiff 4’ (IMO 9678408) arrived off Cape Town, from the British Mediterranean colony of Gibraltar. She entered Cape Town harbour, proceeded into the Duncan Dock and, as is expected of such a vessel, went alongside the Passenger Cruise Terminal at E berth. The question was whether or not this call was a logistical bunker call, or that of a cruise, notwithstanding her having just completed a twelve day, very uncruise-like, sea passage from Gibraltar to Cape Town.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4.  \\n\\nBuilt in 2015 by Meyer Turku OY, of Turku in Finland, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is 294 metres in length and has a gross registered tonnage of 99,526 tons. The interesting comparison between her weight, and the recent call of ‘Anthem of the Seas’ on 25th October, as covered in the 27th October edition of Africa Ports & Ships, is that ‘Mein Schiff 4’, despite her huge size, is actually only registered as being a full 41% smaller than the gross weight of ‘Anthem of the Seas’, which weighed in at a formidable 168,666 tons.\\n\\nShe is a diesel electric vessel, with power being provided by two Wärtsilä 12V46F generators providing 12,600 kW each, and two Wärtsilä 8L46F generators providing 8,400 kW each. As well as providing all onboard domestic power requirements, produced power is also provided to AAB AMZ 1600ZB12 LSB electric propulsion units, each providing 14,000 kW, and which drive two fixed pitch propellers giving ‘Mein Schiff 4’ a maximum service speed of 22 knots. Rather unusually for a modern, and large passenger vessel, she has propellers rather than being driven by a pair of Azipod thruster units.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer auxiliary machinery includes a single MTU 12V4000 emergency generator providing 400 kW. She has two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-340 exhaust gas boilers, two Alfa Laval Aalborg XW-240 exhaust gas boilers, and two Alfa Laval Aalborg CHB-6000 oil fired boilers. For added manoeuvrability she has three bow Wärtsilä WTT40 transverse thrusters providing 4,000 kW each, and two stern Wärtsilä CT300 transverse thrusters providing 3,000 kW each.\\n\\nOwned by TUI Cruises GmbH, of Hamburg in Germany, which is a joint venture between the TUI AG Group, of Hanover in Germany, and the Royal Caribbean Group, of Miami in the US State of Florida, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is also operated by TUI Cruises GmbH, whose company houseflag is displayed on her funnel. TUI AG is a German multinational leisure, travel, and tourism company, and is the largest such company in the world, and where TUI is an acronym for Touristik Union International. She is managed by Celebrity X Cruises Incorporated, also of Miami in the USA.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe second of a class of four sisterships, known as the ‘Blue Motion Class’, the nomenclature of the series is quite boring with, up to now, each vessel receiving the name ‘Mein Schiff’, which as all German language scholars knows translates as ‘My Ship’, followed by a number. Not unsurprisingly, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ is the fourth vessel in the TUI Cruises fleet, with her sisterships going by the exciting names of ‘Mein Schiff 3’, ‘Mein Schiff 5’, and ‘Mein Schiff 6’. The casual maritime observer will not be surprised to know that the latest cruise liner to enter service with the TUI Cruises GmbH fleet was named ‘Mein Schiff 7’.\\n\\nCarrying a normal passenger complement of 2,506, who are looked after by a crew of 1,030, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ has 15 decks, of which 12 are solely for passenger use, and 9 of which are set aside for passenger cabins. She has 1,253 cabins, of which 80% of them have balconies, and of which 90% of the total cabins have sea views. There are also ten luxury passenger suites, with each being two decks in height, and with each having their own private roof terrace.\\n\\nMein Schiff 4 and tug Enseleni.  \\n\\nNot unexpectedly, for a vessel of such size, she has not only a vast array of passenger facilities, but she also provides some innovative facilities for her passengers to enjoy. The ships generally cater for German passengers, and who enjoy some more refined entertainment than the usual cruise fare provided by the cruise line competition. As well as having a three tier show theatre, there is also an onboard concert hall, where ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was the first passenger cruise vessel to include a Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the entertainment crew, and whose members are provided by the DSO-Berlin (Deutsches Symphonie Orchester).\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAs well as the standard pool, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ also has a full length, 25 metre long, swimming pool which allows proper laps to be swam as part of a passenger fitness regime. Other innovative passenger facilities include an onboard maritime museum, and sealife educational facility, a giant outside movie screen, and a glass platform, known as the Blue Balcony’, that hovers 37 metres above the sea.\\n\\nThe voyage of ‘Mein Schiff 4’ to Cape Town is actually not simply a diverted positioning voyage around the Cape to get to her next seasonal base, but is actually a passenger cruise. The voyage began from Antalya, in Turkey, back on 12th October, with a four day voyage to Gibraltar, for a one day stop, before heading directly for Cape Town, a full 12 day sea passage away. Whilst alongside in Cape Town, passengers were noted standing on cabin balconies, and were also seen joining the vessel for the onward passage. Generally speaking, long sea passages with no port calls would not be an advertised option, however there are some passengers who can think of nothing better than a warm tropical fortnight at sea, with no port interruptions.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter a two night alongside stay, and having completed her bunker uplift from the Cape Town bunker tanker ‘Southern Valour’, taken on any required stores, and loaded fresh provision for her passengers, ‘Mein Schiff 4’ was ready to sail. At 18:00 in the early evening of 30th October she sailed from Cape Town, with her AIS showing her next destination was to be Port Rashid, located in the Dubai Emirate of the UAE. So another 11 day voyage to come, with no scheduled port calls, for a passenger complement who will have spent a total of 27 days at sea, out of a total of 30 days, by the time they arrive in Dubai. To some that would constitute the perfect cruise. To others it would seem to be a prison sentence.\\n\\nOn arrival in Dubai, ‘Main Schiff 4’ will begin a full season of mostly 7 day cruises, out of both Dubai and Doha, in Qatar, calling at Abu Dhabi (UAE), Khasab, Muscat (both Oman), and Damman (Saudi Arabia). These will have been completed by the end of February 2025. At which point she will begin her positioning voyage back to the Mediterranean for another full season of cruising. As with this cruise, it will incorporate a Cape sea route transit, and it is being advertised as a cruise, with port calls in Southern Africa.\\n\\n  ‘Totsiens’\\xa0 Picture by ‘ Dockrat’\\n\\nShe is due to arrive back in South African waters in March 2025, with an 08:00 arrival in Durban on 14th March. She will sail at 19:00 the same day, with her next call being Port Elizabeth on 16th March at 06:30 in the morning. At 19:00 the same evening she sails once more for Cape Town, with an arrival back in the Mother City at 0800 on 18th March, where she will spend two nights yet again. From Cape Town, she will begin her northward leg back to Europe.\\n\\nAt 17:00 on 20th March, ‘Main Schiff 4’ sails from Cape Town, bound for Walvis Bay, in Namibia, arriving at 09:00 on 22nd March for a 13 hour stay. From Walvis Bay, she heads for Praia, in the Cape Verde Islands, then on to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, before calling at Gibraltar, and then entering the Mediterranean Sea and sailing directly to Antalya once more, where the cruise will terminate on 9th April. Notwithstanding the Houthis, she is not due back in 2025, and will once more head for the Suez Canal in October 2025, for another Persian Gulf cruising season, and will return to Europe the same way in April 2026.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBanda Aceh, Indonesia -16 September, 2018 : Group of traditional fisherman working to catch the fish with trawl net at Kampung Jawa, Banda Aceh. \\n\\n\\n\\nMore than a quarter of fishers (26%) around the world have experienced harm at work in the past two years – more than any other industry.\\n\\nLess than three in ten (27%) of those who work in the industry say they have ever received safety and health training.\\n\\nFishers in low-income countries are more likely to be harmed at work, and less likely to have received safety training.\\n\\nA global safety charity is calling for urgent change and investment after its latest global report named fishing as the world’s most dangerous occupation.\\n\\nA quarter of fishers (26%) have been harmed on the job in the last two years, according to Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s latest World Risk Poll report, Engineering safer workplaces: Global trends in occupational safety and health. Yet, data from the report shows that more than nearly three quarters (73%) have never received any safety training. The figure makes fishing one of the industries with the lowest rates of training in the world.\\n\\nThe data was gathered by global analytics firm Gallup, which conducted 147,000 interviews in 142 countries and territories around the world, and offers one potential explanation for the worrying figures. Like other “riskier” industries, such as construction and mining, fishing skews heavily towards demographics that were found to be more at risk of harm regardless of their occupation, such as those in more precarious financial situations.\\n\\nFor instance, 15% of the fishing workforce declared they could only cover their basic needs for less than a week if they lost all income. This demographic, globally, was found to be more vulnerable to workplace harm than average – a third (34%) of them experienced it in the past two years (well above the global average of 18%). ',\n",

       "    'text': 'The United States has carried out a second consecutive night of strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, a US defense official said Sunday.\\n\\nDetails of the types of weapons, targets or locations of the strikes were not immediately available, though there were reports of explosions in the Amran and Saada governorates, north of the capital of Sanaa, where the US has carried out strikes in the past.\\n\\nOn Saturday, the US used fighter jets to carry out a series of strikes against Houthi sites in at least three different locations, including facilities the Iran-backed rebel group used to store advanced conventional weapons that have been used to target US warships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\\n\\nThe Red Sea is a vital waterway that connects to the Suez Canal, through which 10% to 15% of the world trade passes. Activities along the strait have effectively closed amid ongoing attacks.\\n\\nThe Houthis, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, are all part of an Iran-led alliance spanning Yemen, Syria, Gaza and Iraq that has attacked Israel and its allies since the war in Gaza began. They say they won’t stop striking Israel and its allies until a ceasefire is reached in the Palestinian enclave.\\n\\nThe Houthi attacks come amid Yemen’s dire humanitarian crisis –– worsened since a 2014 civil war when Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa and toppled the internationally-recognized, Saudi-backed government.\\n\\nThe Arabian Peninsula nation, home to more than 34 million people, is plagued by severe food shortages exacerbated by climate catastrophes. Earlier this year, the country was struck by deadly flooding that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee warned makes things worse for the 4.5 million Yemenis currently internally displaced and in urgent need of humanitarian aid.\\n\\nThe US has struck Houthis targets in Yemen multiple times over the last 11 months but the attacks have continued. In mid-October, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that the US struck the militant group using stealth B-2 bombers for the first time. B-2 bombers are among the most sophisticated weapons in the country’s long-range strike arsenal, capable of carrying a far larger payload than fighter jets.\\n\\nThe attack was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden, Austin said, to “make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks.”\\n\\nCNN reported last month that the US has strengthened its military posture in the region amid Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza and conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon. US forces in the region include a carrier strike group, several additional guided missile destroyers, an amphibious ready group, a marine expeditionary unit and a broad range of aircraft, including fighter and attack aircraft.',\n",

       "    'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery region of the world, particularly the Middle East, has been alarmed by the increase in bloodshed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This has been reverberating well beyond the local boundaries. The Houthi rebels, who operate out of Yemen, are posing a growing threat to the Red Sea. This is one of the most critical developments in the situation. These dangers demonstrate the intricacy of the rivalry in this area and the interdependence of the Middle East’s conflicts.\\n\\nThe Red Sea, a maritime corridor and one of the most significant commercial routes in the world, is at the centre of the problem. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and is crucial for the movement of commercial ships, military ships and oil tankers. About 10% of the world’s trade goes through the strategically important Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, near the southern extremity of the Red Sea. The global economy suffers significantly from failures in this area, particularly regarding energy sources.\\n\\nThe Houthis have threatened the Red Sea for a long time. Sources claim they have substantial influence over parts of Northern Yemen and are supported by Iran. They may now reach the Red Sea’s southern coast thanks to this. The Houthis have used a variety of strategies, such as sea mines, explosive drone strikes and missile attacks, to impede shipping in the area. Major international powers, such as the United Nations and European countries, have expressed concern and responded by increasing naval patrols and security measures.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir latest threats are not isolated occurrences. They belong to the so-called ‘Axis of Resistance,’ representing a broader alignment. This is an unofficial coalition of Iranian-backed organisations, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Rejecting Western influence and opposing the Israeli military’s presence in the area are the shared objectives of this partnership.\\n\\nThe Houthis have connected their conduct to the Arabs and Islamic sympathy with Gaza when we examine the Israel-Hamas conflict environment. They cite opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza as the primary cause of these risks to ships in the Red Sea. This demonstrates how regional actors are aligning themselves against Israel and its allies and using the crisis as a platform to accomplish their geopolitical objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Houthis can impede international trade. Any disruption of Red Sea shipping lanes may significantly impact the global economy. For example, their warnings significantly decreased the capacity of container ships operating in the Red Sea in the middle of 2024. According to some sources, the reduction was as high as 60%.\\n\\nDue to this detrimental impact on the global economy, the international community took action. To protect the Red Sea commercial channels, the United States and a coalition of about 20 other nations initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian. This international endeavour demonstrates how crucial protecting this important marine route is. However, it is challenging to secure such a large body of water completely.\\n\\n\\n\\nSources claim that Iran’s assistance to the Houthis is at the heart of this problem. The gang has received financial backing, training and weaponry from Tehran. To put pressure on its regional rivals, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel, Iran is using the Houthis as a stand-in. By utilising the Houthis’ position to threaten Saudi Arabia’s borders and obstruct the Red Sea’s commercial routes, Iran can show its dominance without actually participating in any military confrontation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe link between Iran and the Houthis is further evident when taking into account Iran’s role in the Israel-Hamas war. Tehran has consistently been a major backer of Hamas, giving them financial and military backing. Iran took advantage of the growing bloodshed in Gaza to mobilise its regional friends, particularly the Houthis, to put pressure on Israel and its Western backers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYemenis are expressing more and more dissatisfaction with the Houthi movement, claiming that they are focusing more on military actions and political manoeuvres than on the urgent requirements of the population in Yemen. A lot of people view the Houthis using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way to divert attention from Yemen’s severe economic and humanitarian problems. While the group presents its activities in the Red Sea area and beyond as a mere show of support for Palestine, opponents claim that this language is a way to shift focus away from their incompetence domestically.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Houthis control all military resources, enforce high taxes on companies and individuals, and neglect crucial public services such as payment of government salaries and economic stabilisation. More than 70% of the people in Yemen are living in poverty, which has been made worse by mismanagement by the Houthi group and the continuous conflict. Many Yemenis see the exploitation of the Palestinian cause as opportunistic, prioritising the growth of their regional power over addressing their internal duties. Also, their forceful initiatives in the Red Sea could lead to Yemen becoming even more economically isolated, worsening the plight of its struggling population.\\n\\nThe international community has responded quickly to the Houthis’ conduct, widely denouncing their interference with freedom of navigation. The infrastructure utilised in these attacks was the subject of several military strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom against their missile sites in Yemen. With the United Nations adopting a resolution denouncing the Houthis’ actions and urging an end to bloodshed, diplomatic efforts have also risen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the more significant geopolitical dynamics — especially the involvement of China and Russia — have made it difficult to enforce these regulations. Because they are afraid of tensions rising, both countries have been hesitant to back any aggressive measures against Iran and its proxies. This is making it challenging to carry out a well-coordinated international response.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe threats posed by the Houthis in the Red Sea serve as a stark reminder to the world of how intertwined the Middle Eastern crises have become in recent years. Their current threats are motivated by broader regional factors, even though their actions are anchored in the continuing civil conflict in Yemen, particularly the competition between Iran and its enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. These tensions have only been heightened by the Israel-Hamas conflict. As a result, the Houthis were drawn into a more significant conflict in the area.\\n\\nStriking a balance between military action and diplomatic measures to address the root causes of these crises is the major problem facing the international community. Long-term solutions to the Middle East crises will be necessary, in addition to heightened security measures, to ensure the free flow of global trade while protecting the Red Sea. Houthis will continue their operations to influence the security environment in the area as the scenario develops.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It was not immediately clear whether the images were related to Monday's attack on the destroyers or to earlier U.S. military action against the rebels.\\n\\nRyder also said U.S. forces conducted precision airstrikes against several Houthi weapons storage facilities in Yemen over the weekend. He said the operation involved F-35 stealth jets, which were seen in Centcom footage.\\n\\nMonday's attack on the destroyers marks the latest Houthi attack on navy warships off the coast of Yemen.

In response to these attacks, US forces carried out airstrikes the next day against nine targets in two locations linked to Iranian groups.\\n\\nGen. Michael Erik Kurilla, Centcom commander, said attacks against the United States and coalition partners in the Middle East “will not be tolerated.”\\n\\n“We will continue to take all necessary measures to protect our personnel and coalition partners and respond to reckless attacks,” he said in a statement on the U.S. airstrikes.\",\n",

Recent remarks that the former president made about how he would get China to stand down from blockading Taiwan caught the interest of some news outlets.\\n\\nBack in July, Al Jazeera reported that US intelligence officials claimed that the Kremlin was hoping for Trump to win on November 5.\\n\\nTrump explained that because he had good relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he was uniquely qualified to negotiate a deal between the two leaders that would put an end to the war.\\n\\nNewsweek highlights that in the past, the New York mogul has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him a “genius” and “smart”.\\n\\nDonald Trump has publicly bragged about his close friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin on more than one occasion. Fifty years ago, one could have NEVER imagined that one day, an American president and a Russian leader would be buddies. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, Trump has criticized the financial and military aid the United States has provided to the Ukrainian government.\\n\\nLess than an hour before Biden was set to speak at a press conference that Newsweek reported Democrats believed was pivotal for the President’s political survival, he made a major mixup when introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\n“Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion”, Trump stated about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as quoted by EuroNews.\\n\\nOn October 15th, reports began to emerge that North Korea had sent, or was preparing to send, 10,000 of its soldiers to help Russia in its war to conquer Ukraine. On October 17th, those earlier reports seemed to be somewhat confirmed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nEuroNews highlights that the European Union is concerned that a Republican victory would mean that the United States would cut off money and resources to Ukraine, leaving Kyiv to fend for itself.\\n\\nUkrainians have had a lot to worry about since Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian Armed Forces to invade Ukraine. But the war isn\\'t the only issue that has worried the Ukrainian population.\\n\\nChina is another superpower looking with expectation at who will the US voters pick on November 6. Unlike Moscow, Beijing is wary of the possibility of Donald Trump’s second term.\\n\\nShanghai is only surpassed by China\\'s capital, where 131,500 millionaires, including 44 billionaires.\\n\\nAccording to The Economist, there are three areas the Chinese government is taking into consideration about whose victory would benefit them more: trade, security, and predictability.\\n\\n“I said, ‘President, we’ve just shot 58 missiles into Syria to an airport that’s housing a lot of new planes. \\n\\nDuring his first time around in the White House, Trump engaged in a trade war with China, raising tariffs and accusing Beijing of intellectual theft and unfair commercial practices.\\n\\nThe world\\'s second-largest economy grew 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024, its slowest pace since the first quarter of 2023, according to Reuters. This was a slowdown from the 5.3% expansion in the previous quarter.\\n\\nThe Economist highlights that Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to cement China as an alternative to the American global leadership. Trump favors isolationism, weakening and dividing the West and benefitting Beijing,\\n\\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Defense Department published its yearly report to Congress on military and security developments in China, revealing the Chinese were making an aggressive push to expand their nuclear arsenal.\\n\\nFinally, The Economist argues that a Trump victory could translate for China in short-term risks, due to the unpredictability of the New York mogul, but long-term gains as Beijing watches from a distance as America falls into chaos.\\n\\nThe report noted that decisions needed to be made now in order to meet future threats that will posed by both China and Russia, recommending that the United States and its partners needed to be prepared to defeat both simultaneously.\\n\\nA Harris victory, meanwhile, overall would be more predictable but also better organized in fighting off China’s foreign policy.\\n\\nThe proposals for the US economy from Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would drive its incredible post-pandemic recovery forward, Nobel-Prize winning economists agree.\\n\\nThen, there\\'s the question about Taiwan. Harris would certainly follow Biden\\'s policy to stand for the island nation, but with Trump, Beijing probably has more wiggle room to work with.\\n\\nIn early 2024, the House of Representatives approved a 95-billion-dollar package to provide military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\\n\\nNewsweek writes that opinions are divided in Tehran about what a Trump victory would mean to Iran.\\n\\nAccording to the Associated Press, US intelligence officials reported that Iran was behind the hacking of the Donald Trump campaign.\\n\\nDuring the Trump Administration, he pulled out Washington from the Iran Nuclear Deal and the US launched a series of airstrikes where General Qassem Soleimani was killed.\\n\\nHouthi rebels are present in Yemen, a country ravaged for several years by civil war. These rebels control part of Yemeni territory, including the capital, Sanaa and most of the Red Sea shores.\\n\\nThere’s also the question if Trump’s support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would translate in bigger and stronger retaliations against Iran.\\n\\n\"But be careful what you wish for,” the lawmaker added, referring to Trump’s wish to bring about a rapid end to the war.\\n\\nThough, many experts wonder if things would be radically different with Kamala Harris in the White House.\\n\\n\"Kamala with the nuclear button is worse than a monkey with a grenade,\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, there’s North Korea. In 2019, Donald Trump became the first US President to ever set foot on the so-called hermit kingdom.\\n\\nBefore Trump was fawning over the letters from his best friend in North Korea, he was using his powers of branding to make Kim Jong Un look like a fool on the international stage. That\\'s how \\'Little Rocket Man\\' got such a diminutive nickname from the former president.\\n\\nAccording to Newsweek, Trump has admitted to “get along great” with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, despite nicknames such as ‘Little rocket man’.\\n\\nWhile the comments from Kang may just sound like more from the North Korean regime they do reveal the increasing tensions between Pyongyang and its enemies after a long period of relative calm in the area enjoyed under Donald Trump\\'s unorthodox diplomacy.\\n\\nTrump in the White House is unlikely to work together with regional allies, such as Japan and South Korea, a chaotic relationship which Pyongyang could benefit from.\\n\\nTASS describes how the treaty will take Moscow-Pyongyang relations to “the next level”, covering culture, education, agriculture and, more alarmingly, security.\\n\\nOf course, this being Donald Trump we’re talking about, it’s hard to know in what direction things will take, with Trump we expect the unexpected. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff plan – 60% on Chinese imports and 10-20% on European goods – won the approval of none of the 39 economists. The proposal to make tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations introduced by Trump in 2017 permanent won the approval of only 8% of those queried.',\n",

       "    'text': '\\n\\nHoman named: Donald Trump has named Tom Homan to be in charge of the U.S. southern border and the country’s border with Canada during his administration beginning Jan. 20. Homan was acting director of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during the first Trump Administration. During a speech to the Republican National Convention this summer, Homan warned illegal immigrants in the U.S. to start packing because they would be thrown out if Trump got into office. Homan proclaimed that he had spent 34 years throwing people out of the U.S. \\xa0\\n\\nAppointments: Donald Trump spent at least part of the weekend working with his transition team at his Mar-a-Lago resort planning ways to bypass Congress and push through thousands of appointments to fill government jobs with loyalists. Reporting indicates they will make acting appointments and use the recess appointment process to avoid the normal Congressional confirmation process for appointees. This would prevent Congress from being able to determine whether a person is qualified for a job and either confirm or reject an appointment.\\n\\nUkraine: Russia has denied a report by The Washington Post that Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine. A Kremlin spokesman said today the report is pure fiction and that there was no conversation between Putin and Trump. Trump said during the campaign that if he was elected he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day. There were reports that Trump’s plan to end the war is based on giving Putin the Ukrainian territory his troops have captured.\\n\\nShootings: One person has been arrested in the shootings yesterday on the campus of Tuskegee University in Atlanta. One person was killed and 16 others wounded in the shootings. A 25-year-old man identified as Jaquez Myrick was arrested. The FBI has joined the investigation. Classes were cancelled for today at Tuskegee University. The shootings came at the end of the university’s 100th Homecoming Week celebration.\\n\\nYemen: Over the weekend, the U.S. carried out strikes on Houthi strongholds in the country of Yemen. Houthis based in Yemen have fired on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have interfered with global shipping through their attacks on commercial ships. They also have fired on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. has staged periodic attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen.\\n\\nBritish Royals: The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, who has recovered from cancer treatments, appeared with her husband Prince William at Britain’s Remembrance Day ceremonies yesterday and Saturday that honor Britain’s armed forces and veterans. King Charles and other members of the Royal Family also made appearances over the weekend. King Charles also has been treated for cancer. Queen Camilla did not appear in public and was said to be recovering from a chest infection.',\n",
